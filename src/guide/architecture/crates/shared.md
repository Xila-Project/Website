# Shared (crate)

The Shared crate provides common utilities and abstractions that are used across multiple modules within the Xila operating system. It serves as a foundational library that promotes code reuse and consistency throughout the system.

Usually, it contains small portion of code that doesn't fit into a specific module, isn't enough in size to justify its own crate, or is shared between multiple modules.
