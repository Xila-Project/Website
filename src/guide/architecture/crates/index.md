# 📦 Crates

Unlike the [Modules](./modules/), which are stateful singletons providing core services to the operating system, crates in Xila are stateless internal libraries that offer reusable functionalities. These crates can be utilized by both modules and applications to perform various tasks.

Here is the list of available crates in Xila:

- [🔒 Authentication](./authentication.md)
- [✨ Bootsplash](./bootsplash.md)
- [🔌 Device](./device.md)
- [🏃 Executables](./executables.md)
- [🌐 Internationalization](./internationalization.md)
- [🧪 Testing](./testing.md)
