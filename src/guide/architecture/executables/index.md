# Executables

Xila embeds several executables that provide essential functionalities to the operating system. These executables are designed to be lightweight and efficient, ensuring optimal performance on resource-constrained devices.

The main executables included in Xila are:

- [WASM](./wasm.md): A WebAssembly (WASM) runtime that allows Xila to execute WASM bytecode applications. This executable provides a secure and efficient environment for running applications across different hardware architectures.
- [Terminal](./terminal.md): A graphical terminal emulator that enables users to interact with the Xila operating system through a command-line interface (CLI). The terminal executable supports various shell commands and scripting capabilities, allowing users to manage files, execute programs, and perform system administration tasks.
- [Settings](./settings.md): A graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to configure system settings. The settings executable provides an intuitive interface for managing network connections, display options, and other system preferences.
- [File manager](./file_manager.md): A graphical file manager that enables users to browse, organize, and manage files and directories within the Xila operating system. The file manager executable supports various file operations, such as copying, moving, deleting, and renaming files.
- [Graphical shell](./graphical_shell.md): The main graphical user interface (GUI) shell for Xila, providing a desktop environment for users to interact with the operating system. The graphical shell executable includes features such as window management, application launching, and task switching.
- [Command line shell](./command_line_shell.md): A command-line interface (CLI) shell that allows users to execute commands and scripts within the Xila operating system. The command line shell executable supports various shell features, such as command history, tab completion, and scripting capabilities.
