# Guest API

The `xila-wasm` guest API moved into **[Xila Applications](https://github.com/xila-project/applications)** with the Wasmi host runtime (Core #551, Applications #2). Core Pages now publishes **only Core Rustdoc**, so the former `documentation.xila.dev/guest/` viewer is no longer a reliable current API reference.

Browse the source directly:

- <CodeReference repo="applications" path="executables/wasm/src/guest/mod.rs" /> — guest API.
- <CodeReference repo="applications" path="executables/wasm/src/guest/graphics" /> — supported LVGL guest wrappers.
- <CodeReference repo="applications" path="executables/wasm/src/guest/wasi.rs" /> — WASI-facing integration.
- <CodeReference repo="applications" path="executables/wasm/Cargo.toml" /> — host versus guest feature selection.

To build a **local** Rustdoc reference for the guest crate in the Applications checkout, run an appropriate Cargo documentation command using `--no-default-features --features default_guest` and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target when its toolchain prerequisites are installed. Consult the repository's feature matrix; generated graphical bindings are not a promise of full LVGL coverage.

For portable Core APIs, use the separate [Host API](/reference/host). See [Build a guest](/how-to/build-guest) and [Graphics bindings](/reference/graphics-bindings).
