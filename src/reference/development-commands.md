# Development commands

Xila now has three distinct Rust workspaces. **Run each command in the repository that owns the task**. All use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/); `MISE_ENV=ci` selects CI tasks. Local task lists are visible with `mise tasks`.

## Core: portable OS libraries

Run in [`Xila-Project/core`](https://github.com/xila-project/core):

```sh
mise trust
mise run deps:npm
mise run check:all
mise run test:workspace
mise run clippy:all
mise run docs:host
```

Core contains portable task, VFS, networking, time, graphics, filesystem, ABI and shared-device crates, and an `xila` façade in `core/src/lib.rs`. Core's default workspace member is `core`, not the former root `[package]`.

It **no longer owns** the `xila-wasm` runtime, bundled guest apps, native/browser seed generators, platform drivers (except `drivers/core`), the native example, the OCI runtime or demonstration deployment. Core's <CodeReference path=".github/workflows/pages.yml" /> now publishes **host Rustdoc only**.

## Applications: guest and host executables

Run in [`Xila-Project/applications`](https://github.com/xila-project/applications):

```sh
mise trust
npm ci
mise run check:guest
mise run build:applications
mise run test:workspace
mise run localization:lint
```

`build:applications` builds the six official `wasm32-wasip1` applications with the `release-wasm` profile under `target/wasm32-wasip1/release-wasm`. The `xila-wasm` package (host Wasmi runtime and guest bindings) and native shells/settings also live here. Check <CodeReference repo="applications" path="mise.toml" /> and <CodeReference repo="applications" path=".github/workflows/ci.yml" /> for additional ABI, release-package, translation and application tests.

The reusable workflow can generate **unsigned development** `.xpk` release assets using pinned [package_manager](/explanation/package-management) tools; publishing still requires appropriate tags/permissions, and does not constitute a production trust policy.

## Platforms: final runtimes, drivers and demos

Run in [`Xila-Project/platforms`](https://github.com/xila-project/platforms):

```sh
mise trust
mise bootstrap packages apply --manager apt
npm ci
mise run build:native
mise run check:browser
mise run test:seed
mise run test:drivers
```

For a seed, first build matching guests in Applications, then run from Platforms:

```sh
export XILA_APPLICATIONS_DIR="$(realpath ../applications/target/wasm32-wasip1/release-wasm)"
export XILA_FONT_CATALOG_ROOTS="$(realpath ../applications)"
mise run image:native
# or: mise run image:browser
```

`image:native` produces `target/seed/native/seed.img`; `image:browser` produces `target/seed/browser/seed.img`. Existing disks are preserved. Direct native launch uses `cargo run -p xila-native-example --bin native_example -- …`.

Platforms' <CodeReference repo="platforms" path=".github/workflows/demo.yml" /> publishes the browser demonstration at **[platforms.xila.dev](https://platforms.xila.dev/)**. `MISE_ENV=ci mise run pages:build` builds per-locale guests, seeds and Trunk pages under `pages/demonstrations/wasm/<locale>/`. `MISE_ENV=ci mise run pages:demo` only builds the browser Trunk frontend from an appropriately prepared local seed. See <CodeReference repo="platforms" path="mise.ci.toml" />.

Platforms additionally owns the native/OCI <CodeReference repo="platforms" path=".github/workflows/runtime.yml" />, driver CI, a deep Core test workflow and [cross-repository integration CI](https://github.com/xila-project/platforms/actions/workflows/integration.yml).

## Integrating independent checkouts

`core`, `applications` and `platforms` each pin dependency revisions; cloning all three `main` branches side by side **does not automatically use your local changes**. For targeted integration, generate and pass a temporary Cargo patch config using <CodeReference repo="platforms" path="tools/dev/local_overrides.py" />. A checked-in lockfile should be regenerated without transient local overrides.

All workspaces use target-scoped Rust toolchains and optional mr-boxington caching. Host checks are not measurements of MCU RAM/flash and do not imply validated ESP builds.

## Website commands

Run in [`Xila-Project/website`](https://github.com/xila-project/website):

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
npm run docs:dev
```

`npm run check` runs tests, Prettier, VitePress and internal-link validation. Source hyperlinks use the `CodeReference` component with a `repo` attribute (for example `applications` or `platforms`) for relocated files; without `repo`, they default to Core.
