# Headless Xila runtime

The `xila-runtime` binary runs a Xila **command-line shell** or a VFS executable without a graphical desktop. It can be built as a native binary or used in a Linux/amd64 OCI image. This is **not** the development image that contains Rust and build tools.

## Image and executable

Platforms' [runtime workflow](https://github.com/xila-project/platforms/actions/workflows/runtime.yml) builds and smoke-tests the image from `Dockerfile.runtime` and publishes to `ghcr.io/xila-project/xila-runtime` on eligible pushes. `latest` follows the default branch; releases receive matching `v*` tags, and published builds receive a commit-SHA tag.

The image runs as UID/GID **10001**, retains its mutable disk in `/var/lib/xila`, and carries an immutable reference image at `/usr/share/xila/base.img`. Its entrypoint is `/usr/bin/xila-runtime`, and its default command is **`shell --network=none`**. The container currently supports **linux/amd64**, not embedded hardware.

## Command syntax

```text
xila-runtime shell [OPTIONS]
xila-runtime run [OPTIONS] -- <Xila executable> [arguments...]
```

Options available in either mode:

```text
[--disk PATH] [--seed PATH] [--network=none]
[--mount host=PATH,xila=PATH,ro|rw[,uid=N,gid=N,file_mode=OCTAL,directory_mode=OCTAL]]
[--env KEY=VALUE]...
```

- `shell` starts Xila's built-in `/applications/executables/command_line_shell` and needs stdin to log in. A fresh seeded installation accepts **administrator** with an empty password. It forbids overriding `User` with `--env`.
- `run` starts an **absolute** executable path in Xila's VFS after `--`. For a WASI guest, use `/applications/executables/wasm` followed by the guest module's **Xila VFS path** and any arguments.
- `--disk PATH` selects the mutable LittleFS disk (default: `/var/lib/xila/drive.img`).
- `--seed PATH` selects the image used **only when no disk exists** (default: `/usr/share/xila/base.img`).
- `--network=none` is the **only** accepted Xila network mode. Docker's separate `--network none` disables container networking.
- `--mount host=...,xila=...,ro|rw` grants an explicitly selected **runtime-host directory** to Xila's VFS. Optional `uid`, `gid`, `file_mode`, and `directory_mode` control ownership and permissions.
- `--env KEY=VALUE` adds an explicit guest environment setting; repeat it for multiple settings.
- `--help` and `--version` display CLI information.

## Isolation and durability

Host directories must first be mounted into Docker and then separately exposed through Xila's `--mount`; a Docker bind mount alone grants no Xila VFS access. Ambient host environment variables are not passed to guests. Use read-only mounts unless writes are necessary.

A writable volume at `/var/lib/xila` retains the LittleFS disk across container runs. An existing disk is **never overwritten** by a newer seed. SIGINT/SIGTERM attempts to flush/unmount before exiting; abrupt termination may lose recent writes. The image is non-root and supports a read-only container root filesystem with writable state and a temporary `/tmp`.

This runner does not provide a graphical desktop, host sockets, an enabled Xila network stack, hardware acceleration, embedded-board support, or sandbox guarantees beyond Docker's own isolation. Guest compatibility remains limited to the WASI API subset Xila implements.
