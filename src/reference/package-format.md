# Experimental package format

This page describes the **implemented development prototype** in [`Xila-Project/package_manager`](https://github.com/xila-project/package_manager), not a stable installer wire protocol. **Do not assume the `.xpk` extension, manifest version 1, TAR framing or signature envelope will remain unchanged.** The final decision is tracked in [Core #402](https://github.com/xila-project/core/issues/402).

## Archive entries

The host `xila-package-writer` emits a deterministic, uncompressed **USTAR** archive. Only ordinary files are allowed.

```text
calculator.xpk                 # experimental TAR profile
  .xila/manifest.json         # required FIRST entry, Miniserde JSON
  .xila/manifest.sig          # optional SECOND entry, raw 64-byte Ed25519 signature
  bin/calculator.wasm          # first manifest-declared payload
  share/icon.png               # second manifest-declared payload (if any)
```

The optional signature is absent in **unsigned development packages**. Payload entries must follow the manifest's exact list and order. The writer fixes metadata such as mtime and uid/gid to zero and uses mode `0644`. It never emits directories, symlinks, compressed content, PAX or GNU long-name extensions.

The reader uses `tar-no-std` 0.5.0's full-archive slice API. It rejects unexpected/nonordinary archive entries, missing or reordered payloads, size/hash mismatches and unsupported paths. This is **inspection**, not installation. Its API does not accept a streaming reader and requires the whole archive in memory.

## Package manifest (JSON, not contributor TOML)

```json
{
  "format_version": 1,
  "name": "xila.calculator",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "target": "wasm32-wasip1",
  "minimum_xila_abi": 1,
  "capabilities": [],
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "bin/calculator.wasm",
      "size": 12345,
      "sha256": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
    }
  ]
}
```

This is a **shape example**, not a real digest or downloadable package. The `sha256` field is the lowercase hex digest of the **uncompressed logical file bytes**. There is currently no compression or alternate file type.

| Signature                    | Optional raw **64-byte** Ed25519 signature stored as second entry                                                                   |

Manifest parsing is `no_std + alloc` using **Miniserde JSON**, not an allocation-free parser. The reader uses `alloc` for the message buffer when verifying signatures. Current validation provides **no dependency solver, path destination mapping, privilege policy, symlink installation or compression framing**.

## Exact provisional signing statement

For a canonical serialized manifest JSON byte array `M`, the implementation constructs:

```text
signed_message = ASCII("XILA-PACKAGE-MANIFEST-V1\0")
              || LE_U32(byte_length(M))
              || M
```

Here `\0` means **one zero byte** and `LE_U32` is a four-byte **little-endian** length. Ordinary, strict Ed25519 verification checks the signature over these **exact stored manifest bytes**. The reader must not reserialize the JSON before verification.

`xila-package-builder pack` accepts an optional **externally prepared** 64-byte signature file. For a signed package, it checks that the supplied JSON is in the writer's canonical serialization. The tool does **not** create or validate the signer's identity or key authorization. There is no production key-ID envelope, revocation or rollback protection. The exact statement remains provisional until #402 freezes it and provides independent golden vectors.

Use `xila_package_reader::inspect_unsigned(&archive)` only for untrusted structural inspection, **never as an install-time authorization check**. `verify_signed(&archive, &trusted_public_key)` authenticates the manifest and then checks file hashes, but the caller must have established key trust separately.

## Community registry declaration and output: different schema

The [`packages` repository](https://github.com/xila-project/packages) currently accepts a **host-only TOML declaration**, not the JSON manifest above:

```toml
schema = 1

[package]
name = "community.weather"
version = "1.0.0"
summary = "Weather application"
license = "MIT"
source = "https://github.com/example/weather"

[[artifacts]]
target = "wasm32-wasip1"
minimum_xila_abi = 1
url = "https://github.com/example/weather/releases/download/v1.0.0/weather.xpk"
sha256 = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
size = 10240
```

These are intentionally illustrative placeholders. Real submissions must provide verified immutable hashes, sizes, source provenance and external release URLs.

Declarations live under `packages/<namespace>/<application>/<version>.toml`, with strict SemVer 2.0 ordering (no build metadata), **1–32 artifacts** with distinct targets, HTTPS URLs and lowercase 64-character SHA-256 digests. Artifact size must be **1–2,147,483,647 bytes**; the current validator requires the URL's path to end in `.xpk`. Supported declaration fields are `schema`, `package` (name/version/summary/license/source/optional homepage) and `artifacts` (target/minimum_xila_abi/url/sha256/size).

The Python preview publisher emits:

```text
_site/v1/registry.json                         # counts/description, NOT a global catalog
_site/v1/packages/community/weather.json       # one package's available versions
```

The registry currently contains **zero published package declarations**. The example under `examples/` is not included in generated metadata. A published preview describes an artifact **without downloading, hashing or authenticating it**; the declared SHA-256 is simply validated for format. All JSON output is **unsigned**.

This contributor schema is distinct from the archive's canonical install-time manifest. A shared, authoritative signed publication schema is future work in [#492](https://github.com/xila-project/core/issues/492); clients must not treat the preview as an authenticated repository.
