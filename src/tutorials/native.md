description: Build official WASI guests in Applications, seed Platforms and launch the native Linux runtime.

# Run Xila natively

The native executable and disk generator live in [Platforms](https://github.com/xila-project/platforms); official guest applications live in [Applications](https://github.com/xila-project/applications). **Core is not a runnable desktop checkout** after the repository split.

## Before you begin

Use x86_64 Debian/Ubuntu Linux with Git, [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) and a working Wayland display for GUI testing. Native Windows/macOS/ARM Linux and ESP32 are not established as supported desktop environments. Cloning adjacent workspaces helps when checking local changes.

## 1. Build the six guest applications

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xila-project/applications.git
git clone https://github.com/xila-project/platforms.git
cd applications
mise trust
mise run build:applications
cd ..
```

The WASI `.wasm` files are emitted under `applications/target/wasm32-wasip1/release-wasm/`.

## 2. Create a native filesystem image

```sh
cd platforms
mise trust
mise bootstrap packages apply --manager apt
npm ci
export XILA_APPLICATIONS_DIR="$(realpath ../applications/target/wasm32-wasip1/release-wasm)"
export XILA_FONT_CATALOG_ROOTS="$(realpath ../applications)"
mise run image:native
```

The image is written to `target/seed/native/seed.img` by the **Platforms** `xila-fs-image` tool. It is a reference image, not a package-manager installation or an upgrade process. Existing writable disks are not overwritten by newer seeds.

## 3. Start the native runtime

From the `platforms` checkout:

```sh
mise run run:cargo -- -p xila-native-example --bin native_example -- \
  --gui --no-network --seed-image target/seed/native/seed.img
```

If `run:cargo` is unavailable in the selected task profile, use `mise exec -- cargo run -p xila-native-example --bin native_example -- --gui --no-network --seed-image target/seed/native/seed.img`.

On a new disk, log in as **administrator** with an empty password. Test pointer input, application launch and window close. The default writable file is `./drive.img`; select a different one with `--disk-path PATH` to avoid modifying an existing installation.

For terminal mode replace `--gui` with `--terminal`. Headless graphical debugging uses `--display-driver headless --resolution 800x600` plus the `xila-debug` tool.

## Validation and caveats

```sh
mise run build:native
mise run test:seed
```

Platforms also owns driver, browser, integration and runtime-container CI. Native correctness does **not** prove ESP32 operation or flash/RAM consumption. See <CodeReference repo="platforms" path="examples/native/README.md" /> and <CodeReference repo="platforms" path="mise.toml" /> for exact options.

For the browser-hosted build, follow [the browser tutorial](/tutorials/browser).
