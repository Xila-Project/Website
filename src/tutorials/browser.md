description: Run Xila's Platforms-hosted browser demo and build matching Applications guests locally.

# Run Calculator in the browser

The live browser demonstration is published by [Xila Platforms](https://github.com/xila-project/platforms), not Core. Open **[platforms.xila.dev](https://platforms.xila.dev/)** for the English experience, or choose a locale under `https://platforms.xila.dev/demonstrations/wasm/<locale>/` (currently en, fr, es, de, pt-BR, it and pl).

The demo runs the browser host (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`) with **separate WASI application binaries** (`wasm32-wasip1`). The browser needs OPFS and Web Locks on HTTPS or localhost.

## 1. Try the hosted demo

1. Open [the Platforms demonstration](https://platforms.xila.dev/).
2. Create or select a disk in the browser's Help panel if prompted.
3. On a fresh installation, log in as **administrator** with an empty password.
4. Open **Calculator** from the launcher and evaluate `1 + 2 = 3`. Close the window and check that the desktop remains usable.

The demo also includes Clock, Pixel Painter, Text Editor, Synth and Weather, subject to the available browser drivers. **An existing OPFS disk keeps its data and old applications**; publishing a new seed never automatically replaces it. Browser storage is origin-specific: the old Core Pages origin and the new `platforms.xila.dev` origin do **not** share saved disks.

## 2. Build a matching local guest set

For development, clone **Applications** and **Platforms** as siblings (Core is consumed through pinned Git dependencies):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xila-project/applications.git
git clone https://github.com/xila-project/platforms.git

cd applications
mise trust
mise run build:applications
cd ..
```

Applications produces the six guest files under `applications/target/wasm32-wasip1/release-wasm/`. Keep applications, platform runtime, font catalogs and image built for compatible Core revisions and the **same locale**. For local multi-checkout changes rather than pinned revisions, follow <CodeReference repo="platforms" path="tools/dev/local_overrides.py" />.

## 3. Seed and build the local browser runtime

From `platforms`:

```sh
cd platforms
mise trust
mise bootstrap packages apply --manager apt
npm ci
export XILA_APPLICATIONS_DIR="$(realpath ../applications/target/wasm32-wasip1/release-wasm)"
export XILA_FONT_CATALOG_ROOTS="$(realpath ../applications)"
mise run image:browser
mkdir -p target/seed/wasm
cp target/seed/browser/seed.img target/seed/wasm/seed.img
MISE_ENV=ci mise run pages:demo
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory examples/wasm/dist
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. The `image:browser` task prepares `target/seed/browser/seed.img` from the already-built guest applications; the browser's Trunk build expects the appropriate seed at `target/seed/wasm/seed.img`. For a local demo build, copy the freshly generated image before invoking `pages:demo`:

```sh
cp target/seed/browser/seed.img target/seed/wasm/seed.img
```

If you use the full CI-oriented `MISE_ENV=ci mise run pages:build` instead, Platforms orchestrates per-locale guest compilation, reference seed verification and Trunk builds into `pages/demonstrations/wasm/<locale>/`, without needing the manual copy.

## 4. Verify and clean up

Test app launch/close, display input and persistence after a completed disk save. Closing the browser abruptly can lose changes not yet saved to OPFS. Stop the HTTP server with `Ctrl+C`. Clearing site data is destructive; see [Browser storage](/explanation/browser-storage).
