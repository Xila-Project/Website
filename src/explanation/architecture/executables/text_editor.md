# Text Editor (executable)

Text Editor is a bundled `wasm32-wasip1` application. It creates and edits UTF-8 files through the Xila VFS without retaining the whole document in guest memory.

## Editing model

The application displays one **4 KiB, UTF-8-safe page** at a time. Enter an absolute file path, choose **New** or **Open**, then navigate using **Previous** and **Next**. **Save** writes the edited document to the selected path.

Instead of reading the whole file into RAM, the editor works on a temporary on-disk copy and uses fixed-size I/O buffers. A file can be larger than a page without requiring memory proportional to its size.

## Storage and failure boundaries

- The parent directory must be writable, with approximately enough free space to hold a second copy of the file.
- Invalid UTF-8 and NUL bytes are rejected; this is a text editor, not a binary editor.
- Saving streams the working copy to the target file.
- A failed save retains the temporary working copy so the user can retry.
- Normal closure cleans up the temporary copy through WASI file unlink support.

The editor is included in the prebuilt guest bundle for **new** native and browser disk images. Existing persistent disks do not automatically receive new guest binaries.

## Working-copy lifecycle and memory costs

The editor separates `interface.rs` (LVGL guest events) from `storage.rs` (`WorkingCopy`). Opening a document creates a unique hidden working file in the **same parent directory** as the selected source. Files are copied in **4 KiB chunks**, validating UTF-8 and rejecting embedded NUL bytes. New documents receive an initially empty working copy.

`WorkingCopy::read_page(offset, &mut [u8; 4096])` accepts only UTF-8 boundaries, returns a page length ending on a valid codepoint, and never needs to load the whole document. `replace_page` edits the on-disk working file while shifting the remaining tail in bounded chunks. The UI retains just the visible text and status, not the complete source file.

Unique temporary file creation tries up to **32** timestamp/sequence candidates. The working copy is removed by its `Drop` implementation when normal cleanup runs; an abnormal guest termination can leave temporary files behind. The parent directory needs enough free storage for the copy and appropriate create/write permissions.

## Save and failure recovery

The UI polls a bounded batch of up to **32** graphics events per turn with a **16 ms** sleep. The open/new action and close requests require a second confirmation to discard unsaved edits. Current page changes are committed to the working copy before navigation and save.

`WorkingCopy::save_to(target)` streams the working data back to the selected path. **It does not atomically replace the destination**; a failed write can truncate or partially overwrite the original. Keeping the working copy lets the user retry, but it cannot automatically recover a previously overwritten destination after crash/power loss.

The path field has a **240-character** UI limit, distinct from the 4096-byte editing page. The default path is `/configuration/shared/text_editor/untitled.txt`. The working-copy strategy gives roughly constant guest memory use at the cost of extra disk I/O and temporary storage.
