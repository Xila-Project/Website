# Settings (executable)

The Settings executable is a tab-based graphical configuration application. It now includes **Appearance** alongside General, Password, Network, and About.

## Role

- Hosts configurable system UI tabs (general/appearance/password/network/about).
- Applies a dark/light theme and five primary/secondary color presets to existing windows immediately.
- Provides shortcut registration for desktop discovery.

## Startup and lifecycle

1. Optional installation path (`SettingsExecutable::new`) ensures shortcuts directory and writes `/configuration/shared/shortcuts/settings.json`.
2. Runtime path constructs `Settings` window and tab view.
3. Event loop repeatedly dispatches window events to tab handlers until close.

## Runtime integration points

- Graphics/LVGL for tabbed UI composition.
- Task module for environment and current-task context handling in specific tabs.
- Authentication crate in password tab (`authenticate_user`, `change_user_password`).
- Network module in network tab via interface control commands.
- Graphics theme controls for live palette updates, including calls from within an existing LVGL lock.
- VFS for shortcut write and network-device opening.

## Data and control flow / VFS touchpoints

- VFS write touchpoint: settings shortcut JSON file and per-user appearance record at `/users/<uid>/.appearance`.
- Shells create private `/users/<uid>` home directories (mode `0700`) and set `HOME`. Appearance records are mode `0600`.
- A versioned appearance record is written through a temporary replacement and restored for the user at login; native/browser startup also restore administrator preferences for the login screen.
- Password tab flow: user resolution -> current password validation -> persisted password update through authentication crate.
- Network tab flow: enumerate `/devices/network/*`, open interface file, issue control commands for status/config.

## Concurrency and event-loop model

- **Event-driven** executable loop: `Settings::handle_events()` drains the owning window's events and suspends on its registered window waker. It does not sleep at a fixed 50 ms cadence.
- Tab handlers perform async operations when triggered by UI events; no internal worker task fan-out in top-level loop.

## Failure semantics

- UI creation/mounting failures return non-zero executable result.
- Shortcut write failures surface during executable registration path.
- Tab operation failures are handled per-tab (status labels/logging) or propagated as typed settings errors.

## Contract vs implementation

- **Contract**: settings executable opens configuration UI and processes tab interactions until closed.
- **Current implementation**: five fixed tabs including appearance persistence, password/network integration and shortcut registration.

## Operational limitations

- Tab set is compile-time fixed.
- Top-level window-event processing is waker-driven; the Wi-Fi panel additionally uses a timer to refresh connection progress even when the user sends no input. The other Network tab refresh path remains event-driven.

## Wi-Fi settings and native demo

Since Core #529, a Wi-Fi-capable controller exposes a Settings → Network → `wlan0` panel. It supports radio on/off, bounded scan lists, security mode/signal/channel/BSSID details, connection and disconnection, and asynchronous progress/errors. Unsupported authentication methods are shown but cannot be selected for connection. Passwords are masked, transient, and cleared after submission or dismissal; there is no stored profile or automatic reconnection policy.

For a headless native demo, run `mise run image:native` first, then:

```sh
mise run run:cargo -- -p xila-native-example --bin native_example -- --no-network --mock-wifi --display-driver headless --resolution 800x600 --disk-path /tmp/xila-wifi-demo.img --seed-image target/seed/native/seed.img
```

The mock advertises `Xila demo` (public test password `xila-demo`) and an open `Xila open` network. This only exercises control/UI behavior; it does not access the host wireless radio or provide Internet access. See <CodeReference repo="applications" path="executables/settings/src/tabs/network/wifi.rs" /> and <CodeReference repo="platforms" path="drivers/native/tests/wifi.rs" />.

## Appearance and per-user homes

The Appearance tab supports light/dark mode and five primary/secondary color presets. The Zinc-based palette updates existing windows immediately, including contrasting text colors.

Each user has a private home directory at `/users/<uid>` (mode `0700`). Appearance preferences are stored in a small versioned record at `/users/<uid>/.appearance` (mode `0600`) and restored on login. The native and browser examples also restore the root user's appearance for the login screen. Changes are saved through a temporary-file replacement strategy; invalid records are rejected.

## Tab composition and event scheduling

`SettingsExecutable::new(vfs, task).await` installs `/configuration/shared/shortcuts/settings.json`. At launch, `Settings::new(context).await` creates an `OwnedWindow` and exactly five `Tab` variants: General, Appearance, Password, Network and About. The tab list is fixed at compile time.

`Settings::handle_events()` acquires the graphics lock, dispatches an event to tabs until one handles it and then suspends on the window's registered waker. Window close/delete ends the task. There is no background worker for tab refresh.

## Appearance, password and network contracts

- Appearance reads the current task's user preferences from `/users/<uid>/.appearance` via `graphics::appearance::Appearance`. The tab applies colors to live windows before attempting to persist the versioned record. **Saving can fail after the UI change has already taken effect**, in which case an error status is shown.
- The password tab gets the current task identity from Task and Users, checks the current password through `authentication::authenticate_user`, then persists the replacement through `change_user_password`. The current UI requires a non-empty current password, a non-empty new password, matching confirmation and **at least four characters**. This is UI validation, not a strong password-policy implementation; it means a seeded user with an empty password cannot use this screen without first addressing that flow.
- The Network tab enumerates `/devices/network` and issues typed controls such as `GET_KIND` (now `n/21`) and `IS_LINK_UP`. Non-Wi-Fi details retain event-driven refresh; the new Wi-Fi panel has its own scheduled status refresh while an association or scan is pending.

The graphical shell provisions user homes with restrictive permissions and restores appearance after login. The executable assumes the current VFS credentials permit reading and writing the relevant files.
