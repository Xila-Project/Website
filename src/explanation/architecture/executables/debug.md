description: How Xila's native Debug executable serves bounded diagnostics, screenshots and synthetic input over a VFS transport.

# Debug (executable)

The `debug` executable is a host-side diagnostics agent. It provides **task/memory inspection, screen capture, a bounded LVGL UI tree and synthetic pointer/keyboard input** through a character-device transport. The payload schema lives in the reusable [Debug protocol library](/explanation/architecture/libraries/debug_protocol); this executable owns the live service and its integration with the Graphics, Task, Memory and VFS subsystems.

## Startup and runtime ownership

`DebugExecutable` implements `ExecutableTrait`. The normal invocation creates an informational graphics window; passing `--background` omits the window but still starts the service. It spawns a Task child called `Debug agent transport` and opens the VFS endpoint `/devices/debug/transport` with read/write access.

The foreground loop checks window events every **50 ms**. Closing the window signals the transport task to stop and then joins it. The transport itself polls its **synchronous** file interface; a busy read sleeps **10 ms** and retries. In background mode the foreground loop has no window-close event, so its lifetime depends on external task/runtime shutdown.

The executable **does not create the transport device**; a platform or test environment must mount it before requests can be served. Graphics access requires a functioning Graphics manager, even for headless UI inspection and injection.

## Request and response framing

The transport reads at most `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES + 1` bytes and rejects requests larger than **16 KiB**. It parses the JSON `Request` enum and applies `debug_protocol::validate_request`. Responses are JSON objects terminated by a newline:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": {
    "width": 800,
    "height": 600
  }
}
```

An error uses `{"ok":false,"error":{"code":"…","message":"…"}}`. Normal JSON responses are capped at **64 KiB**; oversized responses become a `response_too_large` error rather than being sent partially. A successful screenshot returns metadata in the JSON frame followed immediately by the raw **RGBA8888** byte payload, whose length is `payload_bytes`. Clients must read that extra binary frame before the next response.

## Supported operations and limits

- `diagnostics`: memory total/used/free/page size and **up to 64** task records, with a truncation flag.
- `resolution` and `screenshot`: active display dimensions, or a bounded RGBA8888 screenshot with validated metadata.
- `ui_tree`: a bounded, potentially truncated snapshot. Element IDs are local to the snapshot and must not be treated as persistent object identifiers.
- `pointer_move`, `pointer_button`, `key` and `text`: synthetic input queued through Graphics; coordinates must fit the display and the internal signed-point representation.
- Text input is restricted to **printable ASCII**. Key names include arrows, Enter, Escape, Backspace, Delete, Home, End, Next and Previous, plus single printable characters.

A screenshot's `path` request field is validated as non-empty by the protocol; the executable currently captures and streams the image to the client, **not** a VFS file at that path.

## Security and failure boundaries

The agent accepts input requests over its mounted transport; it does **not** implement a login or authorization check inside `dispatch`. Restrict access to `/devices/debug/transport` at the surrounding platform/VFS boundary and do not expose it to untrusted network clients. A service task failure is logged; ordinary input queue contention produces a `busy` response.
