# Terminal (executable)

The terminal executable provides a graphical terminal window exposed as a character device and uses it to host the command-line shell.

## Role

- Bridges GUI events and text I/O semantics through a mounted `/devices/terminal` device.
- Launches `/binaries/command_line_shell` with terminal-backed stdin/stdout/stderr.

## Startup and lifecycle

1. Creates `Terminal` UI object (window, label display, text input).
2. Mounts terminal object as `/devices/terminal` character device.
3. Opens `Standard` streams on that path.
4. Executes command-line shell executable.
5. Runs event loop until terminal window close/delete event.

## Runtime integration points

- `virtual_file_system::mount_static` for runtime device registration.
- `xila::executable::execute` to start command-line shell child process.
- `graphics` and LVGL for window/input rendering.
- `shared::utf8_chunks` for buffered output write handling.

## Data and control flow / VFS touchpoints

- Write path: shell output -> `/devices/terminal` -> `DirectBaseOperations::write` -> UI display append.
- Read path: UI enter key -> validated input queue -> `/devices/terminal` read by shell.
- Control flow: parent terminal loop keeps processing events while child shell uses same device streams.

## Concurrency and event-loop model

- Terminal executable runs a periodic loop with `sleep(20 ms)` while polling `handle_events`.
- The GUI owns `RwLock<CriticalSectionRawMutex, Inner>` state. Reads also use a per-open `Waiter` and a bounded `WaitQueue<16>` to register wakers instead of repeatedly polling when input is empty.

## Failure semantics

- Device mount/open/execute failures return executable error and are logged + printed.
- Resource contention on terminal locks maps to `RessourceBusy` / `file_system::Error::RessourceBusy`.

## Contract vs implementation

- **Contract**: terminal executable exposes a character-device-backed text console and runs shell inside it.
- **Current implementation**: LVGL window + textarea, mounted static device node `/devices/terminal`, and shell child execution via executable runtime.

## Operational limitations

- The input queue receives a line when Enter is pressed; no PTY or full ANSI terminal emulator is implemented. Output recognizes **a small subset** of ANSI-like clear/home sequences (`ESC[2J` and `ESC[H`) but not a general cursor/style parser.
- UI/event loop cadence is fixed and may affect responsiveness under heavy output.

## Device polling, input ownership and cleanup

`TerminalExecutable::new(vfs, task)` installs the desktop shortcut. At runtime, `Terminal::new(graphics::ffi_manager())` creates the window and text widgets, and the launcher leaks the resulting `Terminal` into `'static` storage before mounting it as a character device at `/devices/terminal`. The launcher opens the same device three times through `Standard::open` for stdin, stdout and stderr, then calls `executable::execute(..., "/binaries/command_line_shell", ...)`.

**I/O contract:** the device is a **contextual** `BaseOperations` + `CharacterDevice`, not a direct character device. Each open context gets its own `Waiter`. An empty blocking read registers a waker in `WaitQueue<16>` and returns `Poll::Pending`; cancellation and close unregister pending reads. When Enter is pressed, input bytes plus `\n` enter the queue and registered readers are notified. Output runs through `shared::utf8_chunks`; invalid UTF-8 bytes are skipped rather than preserved byte for byte.

The terminal UI sleeps **20 ms** between event-processing calls while the command-line shell is scheduled independently. `print` uses try-locks and returns `RessourceBusy` under contention; the device maps this to `file_system::Error::RessourceBusy`.

**Current lifecycle limitation:** the main executable ignores the returned shell `JoinHandle`; closing the window ends the terminal's outer event loop, but this code does not explicitly unmount `/devices/terminal`, free the leaked `Terminal` allocation, or join/terminate the shell child. Treat repeated mounts and window teardown as areas requiring dedicated lifecycle tests.
