# Graphical shell (executable)

The graphical shell executable is the session shell that transitions from login to desktop views.

## Role

- Owns login UI, session activation, and desktop/home shell composition.
- Sets task-level session environment (`User`) after successful login.

## Startup and lifecycle

1. Parses startup args (`--show-keyboard`).
2. Builds `Shell` with `Layout` and `Login` components.
3. Runs loop: layout tick -> login event handling -> post-login desk/home activation.
4. Continues desk event handling until shell loop terminates.

## Runtime integration points

- `ExecutableTrait` for launcher integration.
- Context-provided users manager to map the logged user ID to a user name.
- Context-provided task manager to publish the session user into the task environment.
- Graphics manager/LVGL wrappers for UI object/event handling.

## Data and control flow / VFS touchpoints

- Input: CLI flags and UI events.
- Primary control flow is event-driven within one shell loop.
- VFS touchpoints occur indirectly through components such as desktop shortcuts (implemented in submodules), not in top-level loop itself.

## Concurrency and event-loop model

- Single periodic loop with `task::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50))` cadence.
- No internal multi-task fan-out in main loop; concurrency is delegated to underlying graphics/task systems.

## Failure semantics

- Argument parse failures are printed to stderr and return non-zero.
- Environment-variable update failures propagate via `Error::FailedToSetEnvironmentVariable`.
- Desk/Home creation and session environment failures propagate as executable errors. **Layout and Login constructors are currently unwrapped in `Shell::new` and can panic** during initialization.

## Contract vs implementation

- **Contract**: graphical shell executable starts a login-driven user session loop.
- **Current implementation**: explicit login-first flow that instantiates desk/home only after authentication and publishes `User` env variable.

## Operational limitations

- Loop cadence is fixed (50 ms sleep), which trades responsiveness for predictable CPU usage.
- Login updates the **current task's user identity**, its `HOME` directory and `User` environment variable. Inheritance to child tasks follows the Task manager, not a global session registry.

## Authentication and session ownership

`ShellExecutable` implements the native `ExecutableTrait` interface. `GraphicalShellArguments` is parsed with `getargs`, including `--show-keyboard` (`-k`). `--help` and `--version` print to stdout and exit successfully; invalid options report a nonzero status.

The login widget verifies username/password with `authentication::authenticate_user`. Upon success it:

1. Uses `VirtualFileSystem::ensure_user_home(task, user)` to create or locate the private home directory.
2. Sets the Task environment's `HOME` and changes the current task's user ID.
3. Restores appearance through `graphics::appearance::restore_appearance`.
4. Resolves the username and stores it as the task's `User` environment variable.
5. Constructs the Desktop (`Desk`) and Home-button overlay (`Home`) before dropping the login UI.

`Desk` discovers desktop launchers from the shortcuts directory under `/configuration/shared/shortcuts` and launches them with the executable runtime. Its dock reflects live windows and supports window-management actions. The desktop and Home bar hold LVGL object pointers and register C callbacks; Graphics locking and window ownership are required for safe lifecycle transitions.

## Scheduling and failure boundaries

The outer session loop sleeps **50 ms** between handling layout, login and desktop events. Most work is event-driven within that loop; the shell itself does not implement a preemptive UI scheduler. Layout/Login construction currently uses `unwrap`; distinguish that panic path from the typed errors returned by subsequent Desk/Home construction.

Login is not an external authorization service: account persistence and password verification belong to Authentication, task identity to Task/Users, and file permissions to VFS.
