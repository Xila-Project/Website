# Command line shell (executable)

The command-line shell provides a small, bounded shell language for interactive terminal sessions and explicit `shell -c` command source or VFS scripts via `shell -s`. It dispatches built-ins or native/WebAssembly executables through Xila's task and virtual filesystem APIs without depending on a hosted POSIX shell.

## Role

- Lexes and parses quoting, environment expansion, pipelines, conditionals, redirections, sequential lists, and background execution.
- Dispatches built-in commands or resolves executable names through the task's `Paths` search locations.
- Maintains foreground shell state such as the current directory and environment.
- Runs pipeline stages and background lists in child tasks with inherited environments and isolated shell state.

## Startup and lifecycle

1. Initializes `Shell` state with the current task and root directory.
2. Resolves `User` from the task environment; if absent, runs the interactive authentication flow.
3. Loads `Paths` and `Host` environment variables.
4. Runs the interactive line loop when no arguments are supplied.
5. Executes already-separated arguments literally, parses shell source with `-c`, or reads and executes lines from a VFS file with `-s`.
6. Reaps completed background tasks as new jobs start and waits for outstanding jobs when the shell exits.

## Parsing and execution model

The lexer borrows slices from one bounded source line. The parser validates a token vector rather than allocating a syntax tree. Expansion happens when each command is prepared for execution.

`|` binds more tightly than `&&` and `||`; the conditional operators have equal precedence and evaluate left to right. `;` separates sequential lists, while `&` launches the preceding conditional list in the background. Input, output, append, and standard-error redirections are applied to one command from left to right.

Pipelines run stages concurrently through bounded asynchronous pipes, so command output is streamed rather than collected in full. A pipeline returns the last stage's status after all stages finish. Foreground built-ins can mutate the parent shell's directory and environment; pipeline/background built-ins cannot.

## Runtime integration points

- `task` for child tasks, environments, scheduling, and inherited execution context.
- `authentication` for the login fallback flow.
- `virtual_file_system` for command discovery, redirections, file utilities, and current-directory resolution.
- `xila::executable::execute` for non-built-in command execution.
- `file_system::Pipe`-style bounded streams for pipeline backpressure.

## Failure and status semantics

- Built-in failures return status 1 unless a command defines another status.
- Unknown commands return 127.
- Malformed source passed to `shell -c`, or invalid script input, returns 2; scripts report the offending path and line.
- External executable statuses are preserved within 0–255.
- `$?` expands to the previous foreground status; successfully starting a background list sets it to zero.
- Command errors are written to standard error without terminating the interactive shell unless the shell itself exits.

## Bounded resources

Shell-owned syntax and streaming resources have explicit limits: a 4096-byte source line, 256 tokens, 32 commands, 8 pipeline stages, 8192 bytes of expanded arguments/redirection paths per command, 512 buffered bytes per pipe, and 8 active background lists. These limits do not include memory allocated by launched programs, runtimes, or task infrastructure.

## Contract vs implementation

- **Contract**: a bounded command shell with built-ins, executable discovery, composition, streaming pipes, redirection, quoting, and environment expansion.
- **Current implementation**: intentionally not a complete POSIX shell. It supports line-oriented VFS scripts, but not multiline grammar, command substitution, globbing, subshells, descriptor duplication such as `2>&1`, here-documents, or shell assignment syntax.
- Built-ins are registered in one discoverable table used by both dispatch and `help`; recent utilities include `grep`, `realpath`, `touch`, `sleep`, `chmod`, `tree`, `mv`, `cp`, and `find` alongside the existing filesystem/network commands.

`cp SOURCE DESTINATION` copies a regular file through the VFS using a fixed 512-byte buffer. It creates or truncates the target (or appends the source filename when the target is a directory); it does not recursively copy directories.

For exact syntax, statuses, limits, and built-in discovery, see the [shell reference](/reference/shell).

## User-facing command invocation

The shell treats each mode differently. With no arguments it reads an interactive prompt. With `-c` it parses exactly one **shell source string**, while `-s PATH` reads one VFS script line at a time. Otherwise it executes already-separated arguments **literally**, without reparsing metacharacters as shell syntax.

```text
command_line_shell -c "echo hello | grep hello"
command_line_shell echo "hello world"
command_line_shell -s /data/startup.xsh
```

The first form parses a pipeline; the second supplies literal argument words; the third reads a script file. Script lines support LF/CRLF and retain directory/environment state between lines inside the launched shell task. Script failures normally do not stop subsequent commands, but parsing/read errors stop with status 2. Four nested noninteractive shell invocations are allowed. The `-c` mode requires exactly two arguments (the flag and the command source). Invalid UTF-8 input and oversized interactive lines return status 2.

## Script execution and bounded find

A `shell -s PATH` invocation resolves a path relative to the inherited current directory or uses an absolute VFS path, reading the file while standard input remains independently available to its commands. Each line is bounded to 4096 source bytes, with a 4097-byte buffer allowing for CR before LF. Invalid UTF-8, malformed input, read errors or excessive line length identify the script path and line and stop with status 2. A script returns the last executed command status; `exit` stops script execution. Nested `-c`/`-s` invocations are bounded to four levels.

The `find` built-in walks from its optional starting directory, applies exact `--name` and type filters, streams paths, and limits depth to 32 and paths to 1024 bytes. It reports VFS/output errors instead of silently skipping them. See [the shell reference](/reference/shell) for flags.

## Implementation boundaries

- `tokenizer.rs` implements borrowed tokens and differentiates single quotes, double quotes, escapes, variable expansion and comments.
- `parser.rs` validates all tokens before execution, with **4096 input bytes**, **256 tokens**, **32 commands** and **8 pipeline stages** as limits.
- `execution.rs` handles conditions, streams, redirection and background tasks. Its **8192-byte** per-command expansion/output buffer bound and **512-byte** pipes provide backpressure.
- `resolver.rs` scans configured `Paths` directories in order; the **first matching filename** wins. It is not equivalent to a host OS PATH lookup.
- `commands/` contains the built-in dispatch table, including filesystem/network commands. Parent-shell state changes apply only to foreground built-ins; a pipeline or background command runs in its own child Shell.

For example, a background command gets duplicated output/error streams but its stdin is redirected to `/devices/standard_io/null`; the parent prompt can continue without blocking on that job. Background handles are reaped and the shell joins remaining jobs before exiting.

## Status and failure details

`$?` reflects the previous foreground status. Shell parsing failures return status 2, unknown commands 127, and most built-in errors 1. In a pipeline, the last stage's status wins after joining all stages; there is **no pipefail mode**. The shell does not offer globbing, command substitution, POSIX here-documents, shell-variable assignment statements or POSIX-style multiline scripts.
