# Calculator (executable)

The calculator executable provides a scientific-expression evaluation UI primarily for WASM targets.

## Role

- Owns calculator expression language pipeline (lexer/parser/evaluator) and button-matrix UI bindings.
- Serves as a target-specific application (interactive on wasm32, informational fallback on non-wasm targets).

## Startup and lifecycle

- `wasm32` target: creates interface window and enters event loop (`Interface::run`).
- non-`wasm32` target: prints localized informational message and exits.

## Runtime integration points

- WASM graphics/UI API (`wasm` crate guest graphics functions) for window, labels, button matrix, and events.
- Internationalization for UI labels/messages.
- Internal parser/evaluator modules for expression execution.

## Data and control flow / VFS touchpoints

- Primary flow: button event -> expression text mutation -> parse -> evaluate -> display update.
- Constants/functions are translated to parser-friendly textual forms before evaluation.
- No direct VFS touchpoint in executable runtime path.

## Concurrency and event-loop model

- Single synchronous UI event loop in `Interface::run`.
- No separate worker tasks; computations run inline on event handling.

## Failure semantics

- Expression parse/evaluation failures are rendered as localized `Error: ...` display output.
- UI creation failures abort startup (`Interface::new().unwrap()` in wasm main path).

## Contract vs implementation

- **Contract**: calculator executable computes expressions from UI/user input and renders result text.
- **Current implementation**: wasm-focused LVGL-like button matrix, direct string-based expression assembly, and inline parser/evaluator execution.

## Operational limitations

- Intended runtime is wasm32; native targets only print fallback message.
- The guest handles window-close events and exits; the runtime then removes its owned window and children. Calculator is embedded and installed by the browser example and is covered by native headless acceptance tests.

## Evaluation engine and numerical semantics

The expression engine lives in `engine.rs` and delegates parsing/evaluation to **`nanoexpr`**. `evaluate_expression(input, radian_mode) -> Result<Exact<14, 99>, String>` uses an exact-number representation when possible. For example, `0.1 + 0.2` evaluates to the exact fraction `3/10`; an irrational result such as `sqrt(2)` falls back to a limited-precision decimal.

Supported calculator actions include ordinary arithmetic, percent notation, factorial, implicit multiplication and the functions `sqr`, `cube`, `pow10`, `inv`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`. When radian mode is disabled, the engine converts degree arguments using π/180 before trigonometric evaluation. The expression evaluator is depth-bounded (`Evaluator::<_, 4>`), so it is intentionally not a full symbolic algebra environment.

```rust
// From executables/calculator/src/engine.rs, enabled in WASM builds/tests.
let result = evaluate_expression("1 / 3 + 1 / 6", true)?;
assert_eq!(result.to_string(), "1/2");
```

The code assumes access to the internal `engine` module: it illustrates the evaluator's contract, **not an exported crate-level API**. Parsing or domain errors include localized explanations and source spans, such as `Division by zero (0..5)`.

## Guest lifecycle and graphics boundary

On `wasm32`, the main function creates `Interface` and enters its LVGL event loop; non-WASM builds display an informational message instead of launching the UI. The guest uses checked graphics calls, button-matrix events and owned temporary expression strings. The host must expose a compatible subset of the graphics ABI; arbitrary LVGL calls are not automatically available to the guest.

Calculator does not write its expression history to VFS. It depends on the window and the guest runtime's event scheduling, and the `main` path currently uses `unwrap` for UI setup/run failures.
