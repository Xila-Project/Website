# File manager (executable)

The file manager executable provides a graphical VFS browser with directory navigation controls.

## Role

- Presents VFS directory contents in a graphical list view.
- Handles path navigation (home/up/go/refresh) and directory item traversal.
- Registers launcher shortcut metadata for shell discovery.

## Startup and lifecycle

1. Installation path writes `/configuration/shared/shortcuts/file_manager.json`.
2. Runtime path creates window, toolbar, path text area, and file list widgets.
3. Loads current directory entries, sorts directories-first, and renders list buttons.
4. Processes click/close events in loop until window close.

## Runtime integration points

- Graphics/LVGL for window/list/event handling.
- `virtual_file_system::Directory` for directory iteration.
- Task manager for current task identifier during VFS operations.

## Data and control flow / VFS touchpoints

- Core VFS touchpoint: `Directory::open(..., current_path)` + iterative `read()`.
- Navigation updates `current_path`, then refreshes UI from VFS.
- File entries are transformed into in-memory `FileItem` records before rendering.

## Concurrency and event-loop model

- The top-level event loop **does not poll every 50 ms**. `FileManager::handle_events()` drains events under the graphics lock, registers the window's waker with `task::suspend`, and wakes when the window signals new activity.
- Event handlers run asynchronously and mutate local state; there are no separately spawned application worker tasks. Graphics and VFS remain independently scheduled.

## Failure semantics

- UI creation failures return typed `Error` and abort startup.
- During event handling, directory-read and invalid-path errors are **logged and the event loop continues**, rather than automatically ending the executable.
- Invalid path text input logs error and retains current path.

## Contract vs implementation

- **Contract**: graphical executable that reflects directory state and reacts to navigation events.
- **Current implementation**: LVGL list-based browser with direct directory-only navigation and no file-open dispatch path.

## Operational limitations

- Operations are currently browse-oriented; edit/copy/move/delete workflows are not implemented in top-level flow.
- Path input accepts raw text and relies on `PathOwned` validation.

## Exact API, input handling and ownership

`FileManagerExecutable::new(vfs, task)` registers a desktop shortcut in `/configuration/shared/shortcuts/file_manager.json` using `application_metadata::shortcut("file_manager")`. Launch uses the shared `ExecutableTrait` contract and a `'static ExecutableContext`; it creates an `OwnedWindow` with a toolbar, path text area and LVGL list.

`FileManager::new(context).await` begins at `PathOwned::root()` (`/`). `load_directory` opens the current directory with the current task identifier, iterates VFS entries, skips `.` and `..`, and sorts **directories first**, with names in ascending lexicographic order in each group. A `FileItem` contains name, kind and size. Navigation is handled through Home, Up, Refresh, Go and directory-item clicks.

`handle_events().await -> bool` returns false after a close/delete event on the owning window; while waiting, it registers a **window waker**, avoiding a busy-polling UI loop. The event handler logs recoverable errors rather than terminating the process.

The application navigates directories and displays file metadata; it does **not** currently open arbitrary documents in another program or expose copy/move/delete commands. LVGL object pointers are owned by the current window and must only be manipulated under the Graphics lock.
