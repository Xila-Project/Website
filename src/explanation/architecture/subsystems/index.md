description: Understand Xila's installed runtime services, their ownership and lifecycle.

# Subsystems

A subsystem owns or coordinates a runtime capability installed by a final Xila binary. It manages state/lifecycle or the unavoidable process-global integration of an active runtime service. It is not simply a crate with mutable types.

## Foundation services

- [Task](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/task): task identity and execution registry. <HostReference crate="task" />.
- [Users](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/users): user and group management. <HostReference crate="users" />.
- [Time](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/time): runtime time source and startup clock. <HostReference crate="time" />.
- [Memory](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/memory): installed allocator integration and allocation capabilities. <HostReference crate="memory" />.
- [Log](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/log): installed logging service and global logger boundary. <HostReference crate="log" />.

## Coordinating services

- [Virtual file system](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/virtual_file_system): mounted namespace, permissions and dispatch. <HostReference crate="virtual_file_system" />.
- [Network](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/network): interface stacks, runners and socket services. <HostReference crate="network" />.
- [Graphics](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/graphics): LVGL, windows, displays, input and events. <HostReference crate="graphics" />.

## Boundaries

Subsystems use contracts from [libraries](/explanation/architecture/libraries/) and concrete [drivers](/explanation/architecture/drivers/). The final binary constructs them in a valid dependency order and passes managers to [executables](/explanation/architecture/executables/). The allocator, logger and LVGL remain partially process-global by design.

C ABI contracts are [libraries](/explanation/architecture/libraries/abi). Wasmi and guest bindings belong to the [WASM executable](/explanation/architecture/executables/wasm) rather than representing new independent subsystems.

## How to read each subsystem reference

Every subsystem page is intended to serve as an engineering reference, not just an overview. Read its **public contract** first (what consumers may depend on), then its **implementation and ownership** (who constructs it, which resources it retains, and how it is synchronized), then its **failure and portability boundaries**. Use the Rustdoc and source links for exact signatures; implementation details can change without changing the contract.

| Subsystem                                    | Core responsibility                              | Key integration boundary                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| [Task](./task)                               | Task identity, metadata, spawn and join          | Embassy executors and user context            |
| [Users](./users)                             | User/group identifiers and memberships           | Authentication and VFS authorization          |
| [Time](./time)                               | Read current clock and startup-relative duration | Direct character-device clock                 |
| [Memory](./memory)                           | Allocation contract and global allocation        | Target allocator and capabilities             |
| [Log](./log)                                 | Global logging facade and filtering              | Backend `LoggerTrait`                         |
| [Virtual file system](./virtual_file_system) | Namespace, mounts, permissions and handles       | File-system and device contracts              |
| [Network](./network)                         | Interface stacks and socket services             | `smoltcp`, driver and VFS control             |
| [Graphics](./graphics)                       | LVGL lifecycle, display/input and windows        | Target display/input drivers and guest events |

### Stability and completeness

These pages describe the **current Core implementation**, not a promise that every interface is stable. In particular, the time manager's startup-relative reading is not a monotonic clock, the Users credential check is not an authentication mechanism, and logging initialization is process-global. Consult the individual pages for the consequences and known limitations.

For changes affecting application-facing interfaces, check both the subsystem and the corresponding [library contract](/explanation/architecture/libraries/), [driver](/explanation/architecture/drivers/) or [executable integration](/explanation/architecture/executables/).
