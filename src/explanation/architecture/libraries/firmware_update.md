# Firmware update

Core #532 adds the **experimental** `xila-firmware-update` library and an end-to-end native NOR-flash simulator. This is the prototype portion of [Core #526](https://github.com/xila-project/core/issues/526), **not** an ESP32-S3 OTA implementation or production secure bootloader.

## Transaction model

The `no_std` core defines an allocator-independent `Update<B>` transaction owner around a platform `FirmwareBackend`. The backend owns image format, verification trust, staging geometry and boot state. The intended lifecycle is:

1. Begin a transaction for an exact declared image length and backend-specific metadata.
2. Stream bytes to durable staging, handling short writes and failures explicitly.
3. Finish and verify the stored image, receiving a backend-owned proof bound to that staging generation.
4. Activate only the verified generation, then attempt a trial boot.
5. Confirm the running image or recover the previous confirmed image. Aborting never activates new firmware.

The native simulator models NOR erase sectors, 1→0 programming, torn writes, two image slots and redundant boot records. After Core #537, it consumes the **pinned shared verification dependency** from [package_manager](https://github.com/xila-project/package_manager/tree/main/crates/verification), reusing SHA-256 and **strict ordinary Ed25519** from [Verification](/explanation/architecture/libraries/verification) and uses a **simulator-specific signed manifest**, distinct from XPK or ESP/MCUboot formats.

## Device contract

The optional VFS façade is mounted at `/devices/system/firmware`. It uses Xila's Unix-like character-device operations instead of exposing flash offsets or slots directly. The root-owned mount uses mode `0600`, allows **one exclusive opening** (including read-only status openings), and rejects duplicated descriptors.

The fixed-byte ABI v1 uses command family `F`: capability/status queries and the write-directed `BEGIN`, `FINISH`, `ACTIVATE`, `ABORT` and `CONFIRM` controls. A `write` streams image bytes after `BEGIN`. Headers carry explicit version/reserved bytes and each operation validates lengths and state. VFS **read-only handles cannot issue write-directed controls**, including through WASI forwarding. Closing a handle never activates firmware.

Capabilities describe guarantees separately: **authenticated update**, **functional revert**, **verified boot**, and **hardware root**. The simulator implements only the first two; its mutable security floor is **not hardware-enforced anti-rollback**.

## Native simulator and validation

Core includes `xila-firmware-sim`, a process-restart test harness, persistent raw-file backing and deterministic fault injection. Tests exercise corrupted signatures, stale proofs, failed operations, torn writes and trial/confirm/revert recovery across restarts.

```sh
cargo test --locked -p xila-firmware-update --features native
cargo run -p xila-firmware-update --features native --bin xila-firmware-sim -- --help
```

See Core's README for complete simulator arguments, storage layout and signed-test-image recipes. The library's focused test suite uses 22 native tests; the final integrated Core run for #532 passed 1,101 workspace tests. Those results are **not hardware qualification**.

## Hardware and security limits

ESP32-S3 secure boot uses the platform's provisioned trust and bootloader verification, not the simulator's Ed25519 format. Any future adapter must use platform OTA APIs, partitions, recovery state and key policy. MCUboot-based Nordic boards have different trailer, signature and swap constraints. Power-loss, brownout, secure-key provisioning, real flash wear and target-specific RAM/stack/flash costs all remain to be validated.

No production boot protection, signing-key management, update transport or application-package enforcement is shipped by this prototype. The separate #402, #491 and #495 work items own package manifests, installation trust and executable enforcement.
