# Shared

The `shared` crate is the low-level cross-cutting utility layer used by modules, drivers, and executables.

## Role

- Centralizes reusable primitives that do not belong to one domain subsystem.
- Reduces duplication of utility code and shared type definitions across the workspace.

## Boundaries

- In scope: generic helpers and value types (`flags`, `size`, `time`, HTTP/unit/UTF-8/slice helpers, layout-based any wrappers).
- Out of scope: module orchestration, stateful managers, backend-specific logic.

## Internal structure

- Utility modules include `any`, `bijective_map`, `flags`, `http`, `size`, `slice`, `task`, `time`, `unit`, `utf8`.
- `error.rs` provides shared error representation utilities.

## Runtime interaction

- Typically used as pure library calls/value containers.
- Frequently appears at crate boundaries where generic data conversion is needed (for example control payload casting and UTF-8 chunk iteration).

## Dependency model

- Dependency-light by design (`num`, workspace `log`).
- Sits near the bottom of the dependency graph and is imported by many crates.

## Failure semantics

- Errors are mostly local utility conversion/validation errors (for example slice/layout checks).
- Crates consuming shared utilities usually remap these errors into their own domains.

## Extension points

- Add new generic helpers when used by multiple subsystems.
- Keep module additions cohesion-focused to avoid this crate becoming a catch-all for domain logic.

## Contract vs implementation

- **Contract**: stable, dependency-light utility API surface safe for broad workspace reuse.
- **Current implementation**: collection of no-std-friendly helper modules with selective logging integration.

## Limitations and trade-offs

- Broad reuse increases API stability pressure.
- Keeping scope strictly "shared only" avoids coupling but may require small wrappers in consumer crates.

## Core public helpers and borrowing rules

The library is `no_std` with `alloc`. `AnyByLayout` is a borrowed byte-layout wrapper used by typed VFS/device controls. `AnyByLayout::from(&value)` and `from_mutable(&mut value)` expose bytes of a live Rust value; `cast::<T>()` and `cast_mutable::<T>()` attempt to recover a typed reference. The unsafe `from_raw_parts` form requires a valid, correctly aligned raw buffer for its entire lifetime.

```rust
use shared::AnyByLayout;
let value: u32 = 42;
let raw = AnyByLayout::from(&value);
assert_eq!(raw.get_size(), core::mem::size_of::<u32>());
assert_eq!(raw.cast::<u32>(), Some(&42));
```

**Do not treat this as arbitrary wire deserialization.** The byte layout is the compiler's in-memory representation and may include padding or architecture-dependent details. Typed command contracts still need exact type, size, alignment and initialization guarantees; untrusted bytes should be validated through explicit parsing instead.

## Additional utilities

- `Url::parse("https://example.com/path")` splits the borrowed scheme, host and path and defaults to `"/"` when no path is supplied. It is a **small structural helper**, not a full URL parser/validator, so do not use it as an origin-security boundary.
- `utf8_chunks(&bytes)` iterates valid UTF-8 fragments and **skips malformed bytes**; it may also yield empty strings where invalid bytes were encountered. It is intended for lossy text presentation, not for validating configuration or filenames.
- `BijectiveMap` and size/unit/time helpers reduce duplicate representations across consumers, while the `shadow_type` module provides reusable typed wrappers.
- Generic HTTP request/response helpers are data utilities; this library does not own sockets, network routing or an HTTP server.

## Ownership and limitations

These helpers do not register global services and their data lifetimes remain with the caller. Prefer domain-specific types inside subsystem public APIs rather than growing `shared` into a catch-all that forces unrelated crates to couple.
