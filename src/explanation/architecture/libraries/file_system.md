# File system

The `file_system` crate is the architectural contract layer for storage nodes, files, directories, and device endpoints.

## Role

- Defines fundamental types (`Path`, flags, permissions, metadata, errors, identifiers).
- Defines operation traits consumed by VFS and implemented by concrete backends/devices, including optional symbolic-link operations.
- Provides reusable helpers for memory devices, partitions, and MBR handling.

## Boundaries

- In scope: trait contracts and shared semantics for file/device operations.
- Out of scope: global namespace mounting/orchestration (handled by [Virtual file system](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/virtual_file_system)).

## Internal structure

- `fundamentals/`: path, identifiers, permissions, statistics, flags, entry/type primitives.
- `operations/`: core trait families (`FileSystemOperations`, `BaseOperations`, `DirectoryOperations`, ...).
- `devices/`: character/block device abstractions and direct operations.
- `mbr/`: partition tables and partition helpers; `devices/partition_device.rs` implements partition-device access.
- `devices/memory_device.rs`: in-memory block device implementation.

## Runtime interaction

- VFS calls file-system and device traits through dynamic dispatch.
- Device nodes expose `control` commands and read/write operations via the same contract surface.
- Backends like [Little FS](/explanation/architecture/libraries/little_fs) map these traits to concrete storage engines.

## Dependency model

- Depends on [Task](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/task), [Users](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/users), [Shared](/explanation/architecture/libraries/shared), [Synchronization](/explanation/architecture/libraries/synchronization), and [Internationalization](/explanation/architecture/libraries/internationalization).
- Upstream consumers include virtual_file_system, executable, authentication, and drivers.

## Failure semantics

- Uniform `file_system::Error` result model across traits.
- Unsupported operations are explicit (`UnsupportedOperation`), allowing capability probing by callers.
- Backend-specific failures are expected to be translated into this crate's error domain.

## Extension points

- Add new backend crates by implementing the operation traits.
- Extend control-command families while preserving command identifiers for compatibility.
- Add helper devices/partition utilities without changing core trait contracts.

## Contract vs implementation

- **Contract**: typed trait and data-model surface for file and device operations.
- **Current implementation**: includes reusable helpers (`MemoryDevice`, MBR/partition utilities) but delegates namespace-level behavior to VFS.

## Limitations and trade-offs

- Intentionally broad contract surface increases flexibility, but requires careful implementer conformance.
- Policy decisions (mount precedence, path traversal context, async scheduling) live outside this crate.

## Operation contracts and wake-up semantics

`FileSystemOperations` extends `FileOperations`, `DirectoryOperations` and `MountOperations`; a concrete backend implements path lookup/create/remove/rename and attribute access without assuming a global namespace. The VFS owns mounts, caller identity, path routing and authorization; a standalone `FileSystemOperations` backend does not.

The device side supports both **contextual** `BaseOperations` (per-open `Context`) and **direct** devices, plus typed control commands. `BaseOperations::read`, `write`, `flush` and `control` return `Poll<file_system::Result<T>>`:

- `Poll::Pending` means the backend has registered a **race-free waker** and will signal readiness. It must not retain pointers to the caller's buffers or task context.
- `Poll::Ready(Err(Error::RessourceBusy))` is an immediate busy failure, not a request for the caller to spin.
- Synchronous `*_sync` adapters make a **single attempt**; if the operation would be pending they cancel the registration and return a busy error.
- Short reads/writes are permitted. Callers must not assume a successful result consumes the entire buffer.

The `ready(|| ...)` helper wraps a synchronous operation into `Poll::Ready` exactly once, without a hidden retry loop.

## Symbolic-link backend contract

`FileSystemOperations` exposes `create_symlink(target, link)` and `read_symlink(link, buffer)`; their default implementations return `UnsupportedOperation`. A backend can implement native links, or the VFS can store a target path in the file payload and label the entry with persistent `Kind::SymbolicLink` metadata where that capability exists. The VFS—not this library—resolves links and enforces caller permissions. Link support therefore depends on backend capabilities, not merely on the existence of the trait methods.

## Metadata capability negotiation

`FileSystemOperations::writable_attributes()` reports which `AttributeFlags` can be stored by the backend. `get_attributes` only sets requested fields it can actually supply, and must not invent data to satisfy a mask. `set_attributes` must reject unsupported requested attributes **before modifying supported fields**. A later I/O failure may still leave earlier supported attributes changed: it does not guarantee transactional rollback.

`Path` is a lightweight borrowed, `no_std` path type, while `PathOwned` owns its string. Permission flags, user/group identifiers, timestamp attributes and item statistics are shared across backends; they should not be reinterpreted in a driver-specific ABI.

## Implementer checklist and tests

A new backend should validate path operations; propagate `UnsupportedOperation` rather than silently succeeding; maintain per-open `Context` state; support appropriate Poll/Waker cancellation; implement consistent attribute masks; and document geometry, concurrency and unmount constraints. The generic file-system tests in `operations/file_system.rs` can exercise CRUD, rename, directory iteration, positioned I/O, attributes and invalid-path handling.

```rust
use file_system::{Path, PathOwned};
let root = Path::from_str("/data");
let item: PathOwned = root.join(Path::from_str("config.json")).unwrap();
assert_eq!(item.as_str(), "/data/config.json");
```
