# Executables

The `executable` crate defines the native executable contract and the launcher used across Core.

## Role

- Defines `ExecutableTrait` and typed `GET_MAIN_FUNCTION` command contract.
- Provides `execute(...)` orchestration: permission checks, task spawn, and standard stream propagation.

## Boundaries

- In scope: executable ABI contract, launch permission logic, standard stream helper type.
- Out of scope: executable UI/business logic and shell-specific command parsing.

## Internal structure

- `traits.rs`: `ExecutableTrait`, `ExecutableWrapper`, `mount_executables!`, command definition.
- `lib.rs`: launch path (`execute`) + execution permission helpers.
- `standard.rs`: `Standard` abstraction (`open`, `duplicate`, `read_line`, `close`).
- `error.rs`: launcher-level error type.

## Runtime interaction

1. Executables are mounted as character devices exposing `GET_MAIN_FUNCTION`.
2. `execute(context, path, args, standard, spawner)` uses the context's VFS/users/task managers to fetch statistics and check execute permissions.
3. It opens executable file and requests main function via control command.
4. It spawns a task and calls main with `Standard` carrying the same context and the argument vector.
5. It returns `task::JoinHandle<isize>` to allow join/wait by caller.

## Dependency model

- Core dependencies: [File System](/explanation/architecture/libraries/file_system), [Virtual file system](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/virtual_file_system), [Task](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/task), [Users](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/users), [Shared](/explanation/architecture/libraries/shared), [Log](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/log), [Internationalization](/explanation/architecture/libraries/internationalization).

## Failure semantics

- Permission denial is explicit (`Error::PermissionDenied`).
- Missing main entrypoint yields `FailedToGetMainFunction`.
- Task spawn or VFS failures are mapped into crate error variants.
- Executable runtime errors are converted to negative `isize` task return values in spawned task closure.

## Extension points

- New executable crates implement `ExecutableTrait` and mount through `ExecutableWrapper` or `mount_executables!`.
- `building` feature gates additional build-time support without changing runtime core path.

## Contract vs implementation

- **Contract**: executable = mounted character device that answers `GET_MAIN_FUNCTION` and receives `Standard + Vec<String>`; `Standard::context` supplies explicit capabilities.
- **Current implementation**: launcher uses VFS metadata + users/group checks and task spawn under current task context.

## Limitations and trade-offs

`ExecutableContext` carries task/users/time managers, VFS, optional networking, and optional graphics when the graphics feature is enabled. `ExecutableWrapper::new(executable, context)` and `mount_executables!(context, virtual_file_system, task, ...)` bind executables to that context. `Standard::open(..., task, virtual_file_system, context)` opens streams with the same capability set. Required references are `'static`; final binaries own their storage/lifetimes.

- Contract is intentionally narrow (`main` only), simplifying dispatch but leaving richer lifecycle hooks to higher layers.
- `setuid`-style override logic is constrained and permission-checked at launch time.

## Exact launch and executable entrypoint contracts

An implementation of `ExecutableTrait` exposes one static `main(Standard<'static>, Vec<String>) -> MainFuture` function. `MainFuture` is a pinned boxed future resolving to `Result<(), NonZeroUsize>`. `ExecutableWrapper<T>` owns the implementation value plus a borrowed `'static ExecutableContext`, and publishes the `GET_MAIN_FUNCTION` control command as **family `b'E'`, read command 1**.

```rust
use executable::{ExecutableTrait, MainFuture, Standard};
use alloc::{boxed::Box, string::String, vec::Vec};

struct Example;
impl ExecutableTrait for Example {
    fn main(mut standard: Standard<'static>, arguments: Vec<String>) -> MainFuture {
        Box::pin(async move {
            let _ = arguments;
            standard.out().write(b"Hello from Xila\n").await.map_err(|_| {
                core::num::NonZeroUsize::new(1).unwrap()
            })?;
            Ok(())
        })
    }
}
```

The snippet assumes `alloc` is available and the program is mounted with a valid `ExecutableContext`; it illustrates the entrypoint signature rather than a complete runtime launcher.

`execute(context, path, arguments, standard, spawner).await` looks up VFS statistics, checks execute permissions, opens the character device, obtains the main function, and spawns the program in Task. It returns a `JoinHandle<isize>`: **0 means success and negative values encode nonzero program errors**. Launch/permission failures return `executable::Error` before a join handle is produced.

## Permissions and standard streams

`is_execute_allowed` checks owner, group and other execution bits; even root does **not** bypass a file with no execute bits. The set-user-ID override path is intentionally restrictive and can deny unauthorized transitions. `Standard` carries stdin, stdout, stderr and the `ExecutableContext`, which supplies Task/Users/Time/VFS and optional Network/Graphics capabilities.

`Standard::duplicate()` duplicates the three underlying handles, while `Standard::close(vfs)` closes them. `Standard::read_line` currently reads **one byte at a time**, sleeping 10 ms and retrying when a read returns zero. It does not provide general UTF-8 decoding, line-length limits or EOF termination; consumers should not assume an EOF-only input ends that method promptly.

Mounting is done through `ExecutableWrapper::new` or `mount_executables!`. The latter removes pre-existing mount entries, mounts the device and sets `Permissions::EXECUTABLE`. This is a mounted-native-executable protocol, **not** a general ELF loader and not the Wasmi guest runtime.
