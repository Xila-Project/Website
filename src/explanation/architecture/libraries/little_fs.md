# Little FS

The `little_fs` crate is the concrete LittleFS backend that implements Xila's file-system contracts.

## Role

- Implements `file_system::FileSystemOperations` and related traits on top of `littlefs2-sys`.
- Provides mount/format bootstrap paths used before VFS initialization.

## Boundaries

- In scope: backend adaptation, attribute translation, file/directory context operations.
- Out of scope: global mount namespace and path policy (owned by VFS).

## Internal structure

- `file_system.rs`: `FileSystem` type, mount/format lifecycle, trait implementations.
- `callbacks.rs` + `configuration.rs`: glue from `DirectBlockDevice` to LittleFS C callbacks/config.
- `file.rs` / `directory.rs`: context-specific file and directory operations.
- `attributes.rs` / `flags.rs`: mapping between Xila and LittleFS representations.
- `error.rs`: LittleFS result-to-`file_system::Error` conversion.

## Runtime interaction

1. Backend is created via `FileSystem::new(...)`, `new_format(...)`, or `get_or_format(...)`.
2. It mounts using `littlefs::lfs_mount` and seeds root internal attributes if missing.
3. VFS calls trait methods; crate routes calls through a mounted mutex wrapper.
4. On drop, it unmounts and releases leaked configuration context.

## Dependency model

- Core dependencies: [File system](/explanation/architecture/libraries/file_system), [Task](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/task), [Users](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/users), [Time](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/time), [Synchronization](/explanation/architecture/libraries/synchronization), `littlefs2-sys`.

## Failure semantics

- Mount/format/operation failures are translated to `file_system::Error`.
- `get_or_format` retries by formatting when initial mount fails.
- Context type mismatch in operation dispatch returns `InvalidParameter`.

## Extension points

- Additional mount policies can wrap existing constructors.
- New attribute/flag translations can be added without changing trait-level contracts.

## Contract vs implementation

- **Contract**: fully conforms to `file_system` trait interfaces expected by VFS.
- **Current implementation**: based on LittleFS C runtime (`lfs_*`) with `MutexMountWrapper<CriticalSectionRawMutex, lfs_t>`.

## Limitations and trade-offs

- Behavior inherits LittleFS semantics and target storage constraints.
- Relies on callback/config correctness; misconfigured block geometry can fail at runtime.

## Safe mounting and formatting choices

The public constructors have distinct **data-loss implications**:

- `FileSystem::new(device, cache_size)` mounts an existing filesystem and reports errors if it cannot mount.
- `FileSystem::new_format(device, cache_size)` **formats unconditionally**, then mounts. Use only for deliberately disposable or freshly initialized storage.
- `FileSystem::get_or_format(device, cache_size)` tries to mount, but **formats whenever that first mount fails**. It does not distinguish a blank disk from a corrupt disk, incompatible geometry or transient I/O failure. This is unsafe as an automatic recovery policy for a persistent user disk.
- `FileSystem::format(device, cache_size)` explicitly formats the underlying storage without returning a mounted filesystem.

All constructors require an `&'static dyn DirectBlockDevice` and a cache size; they derive physical block size and count from the supplied device and build a LittleFS C configuration. Initialization populates missing root attributes. A transient lock failure during an operation may surface as `RessourceBusy`.

```rust
// Intentionally format an ephemeral in-memory block device for testing.
let device = file_system::MemoryDevice::<512>::new_static(512 * 1024);
let filesystem = little_fs::FileSystem::new_format(device, 256)?;
```

This example is suitable for **disposable test data only**. For existing flash/OPFS disks, prefer `new` and handle mount failure explicitly, without automatic destruction.

## Handle lifetimes, metadata and failure behavior

The backend wraps the mounted `littlefs::lfs_t` in `MutexMountWrapper<CriticalSectionRawMutex, _>`. Open file/directory contexts use shared `Arc<Mutex<...>>` state rather than duplicating raw LittleFS C caches. `operation_with_context` verifies the stored type and uses `try_lock`; a mismatch yields `InvalidParameter`, and contention yields `RessourceBusy`.

`writable_attributes()` advertises the specific `InternalAttributes::PERSISTED_ATTRIBUTE_FLAGS`. This is important: LittleFS cannot necessarily store every VFS-provided timestamp or metadata field. The backend translates file/directory operations through `lfs_*` and maps LittleFS error codes to `file_system::Error`.

A target storage driver must provide correct block geometry, read/program/erase semantics and durability on flush. Cache size and driver alignment need to fit the underlying device; using a correctly mounted VFS cannot compensate for a broken block callback.
