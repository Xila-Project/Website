# Internationalization

Xila uses the external `embedded-i18n` dependency for build-time localization. Core re-exports it as `xila::internationalization`; there is no separate `internationalization` crate under the new `libraries/` tree.

## Build-time language selection

Core's `.cargo/config.toml` selects locale and fallback using `EMBEDDED_I18N_LOCALE` and `EMBEDDED_I18N_FALLBACK`. English is the fallback. Executables use `embedded_i18n::translate!` for ordinary and C-string literals and keep translations in their `locales/` directories.

Core and Applications maintain compiled catalogs for **English (`en`), French (`fr`), Spanish (`es`), German (`de`), Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR`), Italian (`it`), Polish (`pl`) and Simplified Chinese (`zh-CN`)**. The seven Latin-script locales are included in the deployment demonstrations; Chinese can be built and validated but has not completed native-speaker/embedded-device review and is **not enabled in deployment bundles**. Languages require separately built, matching host, guest and seed-image artifacts; no runtime language selector is implemented.

The selected translations are embedded in the build. This avoids carrying a dynamic catalog lookup in each runtime call; language choice belongs to the build configuration rather than a live session-language service. Quantity-dependent text uses CLDR plural variants where needed (for example, stopwatch laps, DNS record counts and ping byte counts); Polish requires `one`, `few`, `many` and `other`.

## Graphics assets and translation tooling

The Graphics crate's Rust build helpers generate and cache deduplicated font-range variants in Cargo `OUT_DIR`. Every font C object has a unique symbol; `subsystems/graphics/src/fonts.rs` selects the six active locale/fallback symbols at compile time so unselected archive members do not add font data to the linked executable (Core #508). For `zh-CN`, Source Han Sans SC provides only the Chinese characters and punctuation found in selected translation **values**, rather than the full CJK range (Core #456). Arbitrary user-supplied Chinese is not guaranteed covered. The standalone `fonts_generator` task remains removed. Node is used to run `lv_font_conv`, not for Rust catalog discovery.

Core #517 migrated the Rust macro calls and JSON catalogs from English-message keys to **stable semantic IDs**, formatted as lowercase snake_case segments separated by dots (`feature.component.purpose`). Wording-only edits retain the ID; meaning or placeholder-contract changes require a new ID and translator review. Separate contexts should not share a key solely because their English text matches. CLDR plural suffixes (for example `.one`, `.few`, `.many`, `.other`) remain locale-specific. The migration retained translation values but did **not** migrate remote Tolgee history or keys; avoid destructive synchronization without an explicit migration plan.

Tolgee extraction uses `tolgee.config.ts` and a token-aware Rust macro scanner in `tolgee.extractor.mjs`. Per-namespace old-to-new mappings and validation are in <CodeReference path="tools/localization/mappings" /> and <CodeReference path="tools/localization/check.mjs" />. See <CodeReference path="tools/localization/README.md" /> for conventions and the [development command reference](/reference/development-commands#common-core-tasks) for current mise commands.

## Nested catalog files (Core #528)

All **160 non-empty catalogs across 20 localized namespaces and eight locales** now use **nested JSON objects** instead of flat keys. Rust macro calls and Tolgee still use the same stable dotted semantic identifiers; translated values and locale-specific CLDR plurals were preserved.

```json
{
  "alarm": {
    "controls": {
      "delete": "Delete"
    }
  }
}
```

This is accessed as `translate!("alarm.controls.delete")`. The shared `tools/localization/catalog.mjs` flattener rejects duplicate paths and parent/leaf collisions rather than silently overwriting keys. `tolgee.config.ts` retains `JSON_C` and sets `pull.delimiter: "."` to export nested JSON; `push.removeOtherKeys` remains **false**. A real remote Tolgee push/pull was **not** validated in #528: inspect the first synchronization carefully and avoid `tolgee pull --empty-dir` during migration.

Test the new catalog behavior with `node --test tools/localization/catalog.test.mjs`, `mise run localization:lint` and the usual strict per-locale builds. See <CodeReference path="tools/localization/README.md" />.

## Compile-time integration contract

Xila does not currently maintain a separate `internationalization` crate in `libraries/`. Instead, its entrypoint re-exports the external `embedded-i18n` crate and the project provides locale catalogs and build tooling. This page describes that **cross-cutting build integration**, not a runtime manager.

Use the build-time locale and fallback consistently across host binaries, WebAssembly guests, generated fonts and reference seed images. Locale strings are compiled into the binaries, so changing the preferred language **requires rebuilding compatible artifacts**; there is no persistent per-user runtime language selector.

`embedded_i18n::track_locales!()` declares the translation integration for crates with catalogs, while `translate!` selects the appropriate compiled key. Pluralized strings need the CLDR categories supported by each locale: missing `few` or `many` variants are especially noticeable in Polish.

## End-to-end update workflow

1. Add a stable dotted semantic ID to an executable/library `translate!` call, keeping user-facing English text in its `en.json` catalog. Do not use the English message itself as the key.
2. Add translations under that crate's `locales/<locale>.json`, preserving the intended namespace and plural categories.
3. Run `mise run localization:lint` and `node --test tolgee.extractor.test.mjs`; check `tools/localization/mappings/` for historical key mapping and use strict per-locale compilation (`EMBEDDED_I18N_LOCALE=fr EMBEDDED_I18N_STRICT=1 mise run localization:check`) for affected locales. Do not remove unused Tolgee keys automatically.
4. Build **host, guests and seeded disk content for the same locale**. Cargo regenerates and compiles the locale-dependent graphics font archive as needed; install the Core workspace's Node dependencies with `npm ci` before building graphics.
5. Check text truncation, symbol availability and UI layout in Graphics.

The Graphics font inputs live in `subsystems/graphics/fonts/` and generation is handled by `subsystems/graphics/build.rs`, rather than by a separate executable. These build artifacts are not a runtime localization subsystem.

## Limitations and references

English fallback prevents missing-key failures but does not guarantee appropriate terminology or glyph coverage. Language completeness needs review on the actual display and guest programs.
