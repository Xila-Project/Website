# Testing

The `testing` crate assembles a host integration runtime so tests can run against near-real Core wiring.

## Role

- Provides one high-level initializer that wires task/users/time, storage, optional graphics, optional networking, and standard streams.
- Reduces per-test boilerplate by mounting known-good baseline devices and hierarchy.

## Boundaries

- In scope: integration-runtime bootstrap for tests.
- Out of scope: unit-test micro scaffolding and production startup orchestration.

## Internal structure

- `lib.rs` exposes `initialize(graphics_enabled, network_enabled) -> executable::Standard<'static>`; the result carries an `ExecutableContext` with the assembled managers.
- Setup logic is sequential and explicit: logging, managers, VFS root, device mounts, optional subsystems, seed user/account.

## Runtime interaction

1. Uses the task test-harness manager and constructs users/time managers; registers the logger.
2. Optionally starts graphics manager and host window runner tasks.
3. Creates memory-backed LittleFS and initializes VFS + default hierarchy.
4. Mounts standard devices (`/devices/random`, `/devices/hasher`, stdio, time, null).
5. Optionally mounts/configures a tuntap network interface and applies IP/routes/DNS.
6. Seeds administrator group/user and environment variables (`Paths`, `Host`).
7. Builds an `ExecutableContext` and returns opened `Standard` streams carrying those references for test/executable launch.

## Dependency model

- Depends on broad Core surface: file_system, little_fs, authentication, executable, network, graphics, task/users/time/log, plus host drivers.

## Failure semantics

- Initialization is intentionally strict and uses `unwrap`/`expect` in many places to fail fast in test setup.
- Optional branches still fail the initializer if enabled and setup cannot complete.

## Extension points

- Additional device mounts can be added to the bootstrap sequence for new integration domains.
- Feature toggles can extend the initializer signature if more optional subsystems are needed.

## Contract vs implementation

- **Contract**: one async initializer returning ready-to-use `Standard` for executing test binaries/workflows.
- **Current implementation**: host-first initialization with memory-backed LittleFS, optional window/tuntap integration, and seeded administrator account.

## Limitations and trade-offs

- Fast-fail setup simplifies test diagnosis but is less granular than layered setup APIs.
- Integration realism increases coverage while making initialization heavier than unit-test stubs.

## Entry point and required environment

`testing::initialize(graphics_enabled, network_enabled).await` returns `executable::Standard<'static>` carrying a populated `ExecutableContext`. It is an **integration test fixture**: it leaks boxed runtime managers into `'static` storage, installs the global logger and invokes the Task test-harness manager. Consequently it is not intended to construct multiple independent production OS instances in one process.

```rust
let mut standard = testing::initialize(false, false).await;
let task = standard.context.task_manager.get_current_task_identifier().await;
let vfs = standard.context.virtual_file_system;
assert!(vfs.get_statistics(&"/devices/null").await.is_ok());
```

This is an integration-harness example. A suitable test executor/spawner, global allocator and host driver environment must already be configured; the initializer does not install all of them in an otherwise empty process.

## Fixture composition and feature-dependent behavior

The fixture creates a **512 KiB in-memory block device** with `MemoryDevice::<512>::new_static`, formats LittleFS with a cache size of 256 bytes, mounts it as the VFS root and creates the default hierarchy. It exposes random/time/hash/null/console/CPU-information devices. The seeded administrator has group and user ID 1000 and is created with an **empty password**; this is test-only behavior, not a production default.

- When graphics is enabled, it starts an 800 × 600 native window, creates the Graphics manager and spawns both LVGL and screen runner tasks.
- When networking is enabled, it uses the platform TUN/TAP driver, configures a tunnel interface and mounts HTTP/HTTPS client devices. This requires host networking support and permissions.
- The returned Standard streams expose the same live devices and managers to launched executables.

The function signature accepts `graphics_enabled` even when the crate's `graphics` Cargo feature is disabled; check the configured feature set before assuming graphics types and setup exist. The fixture intentionally uses `unwrap`/`expect` on setup failures so tests fail immediately rather than returning a recoverable configuration error.

## Isolation and cleanup limitations

Managers and devices are leaked for lifetime convenience. Global logger state and the Task test harness can affect later tests in the same process. Prefer **separate test processes** for scenarios that mutate global runtime state, and use narrower mocks (`GpioMock`, a memory device, etc.) for small deterministic unit tests.
