# Synchronization

The `synchronization` crate standardizes synchronization primitives used across Core.

## Role

- Re-exports `embassy_sync` primitives through one crate-local entry point.
- Provides portable `Arc`/`Weak` support, including a custom fallback for targets without atomic pointer support.

## Boundaries

- In scope: synchronization primitives and ownership wrappers.
- Out of scope: scheduler/executor implementation and task lifecycle policy.

## Internal structure

- `lib.rs`: top-level re-exports.
- `arc/mod.rs`: target-gated arc selection.
  - With `target_has_atomic = "ptr"`: uses `alloc::sync::Arc`/`Weak`.
  - Without pointer atomics: uses `arc/arc_lock.rs` mutex-backed Arc implementation.

## Runtime interaction

- Modules and executables import mutex/rwlock/once/channel primitives from this crate.
- Fallback Arc implementation uses `CriticalSectionRawMutex` + `RefCell` counters for no-atomic targets.

## Dependency model

- Primary dependency: `embassy-sync` (std feature enabled on host targets).
- Broadly consumed by file-system backends, graphics, and other concurrent modules.

## Failure semantics

- Most primitives are infallible at API level; contention manifests as wait/lock behavior.
- Fallback Arc enforces overflow checks on reference counters and may panic on overflow.

## Extension points

- Additional wrappers/adapters can be added to normalize synchronization semantics across targets.
- Arc fallback can evolve independently while preserving exported `Arc`/`Weak` contract.

## Contract vs implementation

- **Contract**: one consistent synchronization import surface across platforms.
- **Current implementation**: direct `embassy_sync` re-export plus conditional Arc fallback implementation.

## Limitations and trade-offs

- Behavior still inherits cooperative runtime assumptions from executor usage patterns.
- Fallback Arc prioritizes portability over lock-free performance.

## Choosing an abstraction

The crate is `#![no_std]`, re-exports **`embassy_sync`** and provides `synchronization::Arc`/`Weak`. Choose primitives according to the execution context:

- `mutex::Mutex` and `rwlock::RwLock` support async tasks sharing state; avoid holding a guard across lengthy operations that block protocol progress.
- `blocking_mutex` and its `CriticalSectionRawMutex` are for short synchronous critical sections. A critical section does **not** automatically mean independent threads or interrupts may block arbitrarily.
- `signal`, channels and `once_lock` provide task notification and one-time publication, used by Task, VFS and other services.
- `Arc`/`Weak` manage heap-backed shared ownership, not scheduling or resource cleanup policy.

## Portability and memory model

When `target_has_atomic = "ptr"`, `Arc` and `Weak` come directly from `alloc::sync`. Otherwise Xila exports a custom `arc_lock` implementation using `CriticalSectionRawMutex` and interior-mutable reference counts. Both expose `Arc::new`, `clone`, `downgrade`, `Weak::upgrade`, `strong_count`, `weak_count`, `get_mut` and `ptr_eq` style APIs.

```rust
use synchronization::Arc;
let data = Arc::new(42);
let another = Arc::clone(&data);
assert!(Arc::ptr_eq(&data, &another));
```

The no-atomic fallback allocates an `ArcInner<T>` on the heap. Its reference counters are checked for overflow (which panics) and protected by critical-section locks, so cloning/dropping has a different performance cost from atomics. `get_mut` only returns mutable access when the allocation has a unique strong owner with no conflicting weak ownership.

`Arc` only provides **shared ownership**. Access to mutable `T` must still use synchronization appropriate for the target, and dropping the last reference is not a substitute for explicitly closing a VFS file, stopping a graphics animation, or tearing down a device context.
