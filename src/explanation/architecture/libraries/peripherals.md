# Peripherals

The `peripherals` crate currently provides a **GPIO controller contract** and a deterministic mock. It is a reusable hardware abstraction, not a runtime-managed peripheral service or a complete SPI/I²C/UART implementation.

## API and feature boundaries

The `gpio` feature exposes `GpioController`, `LineId`, `LineCapabilities`, `InputConfig`, `OutputConfig`, `Pull`, `DriveMode`, and `PinState`. The `mock` feature exposes `GpioMock<N>`, `MockInput`, `MockOutput`, and `MockError`.

`GpioController` declares a controller-specific `Error` implementing `embedded_hal::digital::Error`, and lifetime-bound associated types `Input<'a>` and `Output<'a>`. Input handles implement `embedded_hal::digital::InputPin`; output handles implement both `OutputPin` and `StatefulOutputPin`. The three controller methods are:

- `capabilities(LineId) -> Option<LineCapabilities>`: query an existing line's supported operations.
- `request_input(LineId, InputConfig)`: reserve an input line and return a borrowed handle.
- `request_output(LineId, OutputConfig)`: reserve an output line and return a borrowed handle.

The returned handles borrow the controller, so callers cannot treat them as detached, indefinitely owned device objects.

## Configurations and validation

`LineId::new(offset)` wraps a `u16` line offset. `LineCapabilities` reports whether the line supports input, output, pull-up, pull-down and open-drain. `InputConfig` chooses `Pull::Disabled`, `Up`, or `Down` (disabled by default). `OutputConfig` adds `DriveMode::PushPull` or `OpenDrain` and an initial physical `PinState::Low` or `High`.

Controllers may reject an invalid line, a line already reserved by another handle, or a requested capability that hardware does not support. Reserving a line is exclusive until the handle is dropped. The output initial state is applied when the output is requested.

## Heap-free mock for tests

`GpioMock<N>` receives an array of `N` line capabilities and stores state in fixed-capacity memory. Its line handles implement the same `embedded-hal` digital traits as real adapters. Tests can call `set_input_level()` to inject an input level, read it through `InputPin`, and verify output levels through `StatefulOutputPin`.

```rust
use embedded_hal::digital::{InputPin, OutputPin, StatefulOutputPin};
use peripherals::gpio::{
    DriveMode, GpioController, GpioMock, InputConfig, LineCapabilities,
    LineId, OutputConfig, PinState, Pull,
};

let capabilities = LineCapabilities {
    input: true, output: true, pull_up: true,
    pull_down: true, open_drain: true,
};
let gpio = GpioMock::new([capabilities; 2]);
let line = LineId::new(0);
gpio.set_input_level(line, PinState::High)?;
let mut input = gpio.request_input(line, InputConfig::default())?;
assert!(input.is_high()?);
drop(input);

let mut output = gpio.request_output(
    line,
    OutputConfig::new(Pull::Disabled, DriveMode::PushPull, PinState::Low),
)?;
output.set_high()?;
assert!(output.is_set_high()?);
```

This example requires the `gpio` and `mock` features. The mock tests cover invalid IDs, exclusive reservations, release on drop, initial output level, injected input state, and unsupported pull/drive modes.

## Migration and limitations

The earlier `PinData` byte-buffer interface has been removed. Consumers should migrate to typed controller requests and borrowed line handles; serialized pin-state operations are no longer the GPIO API.

Board-specific adapters remain separate work. A passing mock test does not establish that a particular MCU pin, interrupt, pull resistor or electrical mode is supported. The Espressif integration remains constrained by the target/toolchain work tracked in Core issue #328.
