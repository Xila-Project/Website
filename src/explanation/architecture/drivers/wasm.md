# WASM driver crate

The `drivers_wasm` crate provides drivers for WebAssembly targets (`wasm32`).

It offers browser/web runtime integrations such as memory/logging adapters, async execution support, and devices including time, drive, and HTTP client access.

## Persistent drive

The browser example uses `devices::DriveDevice` to open the origin-private file `xila_drive.img` using OPFS and hold a lifetime Web Lock. This main-thread driver keeps a bounded memory cache (16 MiB in the browser example) and commits snapshots asynchronously through `sync().await`. Synchronous block writes/flushes update the cache; they do not establish OPFS durability.

Only dirty disks are saved. Saves are serialized and atomic, with at most one additional disk-sized snapshot rather than a growing queue. Failures leave unsaved changes available for retry; the caller must handle errors. OPFS quota/eviction and abrupt tab termination can still lose data.

The browser example validates existing MBR/LittleFS data and stops on mount errors instead of reformatting a saved image. See [Browser storage](/explanation/browser-storage) for the cache/autosave model and [Reset the browser disk](/how-to/reset-browser-storage) for a deliberate reset.

## Canvas color conversion

When Xila renders a dirty rectangle to browser Canvas `ImageData`, its little-endian XRGB8888 buffer must be converted from byte order BGRA-like (`B,G,R,X`) to the Canvas `R,G,B,A` order. The SIMD converter now handles trailing complete pixels after 16-byte vector chunks instead of copying their bytes unchanged (Core #403). This matters for rectangles whose pixel count is not divisible by four; it does not change the guest graphics ABI or introduce a new graphics capability.

## Browser audio

The browser example mounts `/devices/audio/playback` only after an explicit **Enable audio** user gesture. This starts the Web Audio context in accordance with browser autoplay restrictions. The [Synth guest](/explanation/architecture/executables/synth) can retry audio initialization without requiring an OS restart.

## Browser capabilities

OPFS, `FileSystemFileHandle.createWritable`, and Web Locks require an appropriate browser and localhost/HTTPS. Only one Xila tab can hold the disk lock. The HTTP device uses Fetch and follows browser restrictions such as CORS; it does not expose raw sockets or provide the Xila network manager.
