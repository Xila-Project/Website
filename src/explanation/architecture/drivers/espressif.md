# Espressif driver crate

The `drivers_espressif` crate contains platform-specific drivers for Espressif targets.

It includes chip-specific integrations and shared helpers for ESP families (for example ESP32 and ESP32-S3), including pin and file-system related support code.

## Dependencies

This crate is intentionally small and keeps dependencies minimal to stay close to the platform.
