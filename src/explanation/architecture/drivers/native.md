# Native driver crate

The `drivers_native` crate provides desktop-host integrations for native targets (Linux, macOS, Windows).

It is used for host-side runtime features such as window-backed display/input handling and native integrations used by development and testing flows.

The native example also initializes audio playback through the default host output for [Synth](/explanation/architecture/executables/synth). If audio is unavailable, the OS can still boot and applications can run in silent mode.

For headless workloads, native HostFS supplies explicitly mounted host-directory access to [the container runtime](/reference/container-runtime). Mounts can be read-only or writable, with Linux path-race defenses and no ambient filesystem access.

## Native Wi-Fi mock

Core #529 includes a deterministic mock Wi-Fi station controller under `drivers/native/src/devices/wifi/`. The native example's `--mock-wifi` flag creates a `wlan0` interface for Settings scans and connect/disconnect testing without interacting with the host radio. The mock publishes at most 16 access points and supports one pending operation, configurable association outcomes and generation-checked scans. This is **not a real Wi-Fi driver** and has no Internet connectivity. See [Network](/explanation/architecture/subsystems/network) and <CodeReference path="drivers/native/tests/wifi.rs" /> for its control-plane tests.
