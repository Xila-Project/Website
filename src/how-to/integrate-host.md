description: Assemble a host Xila runtime with explicit managers, drivers, and executable capabilities.

# Integrate Xila into a host application

Use the native example's assembly to connect Xila services and executables to your host application.

## Before you begin

Complete the [native tutorial](/tutorials/native) or establish a working [development environment](./setup-development). Read the [runtime assembly overview](/explanation/architecture/#runtime-assembly) and identify your display, time, storage, and executor drivers.

The procedure is an integration outline; <CodeReference path="examples/native/src/main.rs" /> provides the complete executable example.

## Add the dependencies

In your application's Cargo manifest:

```toml
[dependencies]
xila = { git = "https://github.com/Xila-Project/Core.git", features = ["graphics_rendering_xrgb8888"] }
```

This enables Core's default services and the optional XRGB8888 graphics rendering path. Select features appropriate to your actual display. The package has no `host` feature.

Add platform drivers separately, such as `drivers_std` and `drivers_native`; they are not re-exported through `xila::drivers`.

## Assemble the runtime

1. Construct a task manager and connect it to your executor bootstrap, following the example's `#[task::run(...)]` manager argument.
2. Register the allocator/logger and construct users/time managers with their platform drivers.
3. Initialize graphics with the time manager and screen/input devices. Register the FFI manager for callbacks that cannot carry Rust references.
4. Construct VFS from task/users/time managers and a root filesystem; create the default hierarchy and mount devices. Register the separate C ABI runtime context if your runtime uses it.
5. Initialize optional networking with its task/VFS/time/random dependencies.
6. Build an `ExecutableContext`, mount executables with it, and open `Standard` streams carrying the same context.
7. Launch with `executable::execute(context, path, args, standard, spawner)` and join the returned task when needed.

Keep manager storage alive for its consumers. The examples use static storage and leaked boxes for required `'static` references; plan ownership and RAM costs for your target.

## Verify completion

Build for your actual host target, start the runtime, and launch a mounted executable. Check that it uses the same context/VFS that created its streams. For graphical integration, exercise input and window closing in the supported native session.
