# Manage browser disks

Use the browser example's Help panel to create another Xila disk, switch between saved disks, or permanently remove an unused image.

## Before you begin

::: warning Removing a disk erases its data
Deleting an image permanently removes the files, configuration, and credentials stored on that disk. Copy anything you need before removing it. Clearing all site data is broader and can remove every Xila image and other storage belonging to the same origin.
:::

Browser disks are origin-specific. The legacy/default image is `xila_drive.img`; new images use date-based names such as `xila_2026-10-17.img` and receive a numeric suffix when necessary.

## Create a fresh disk

1. Open the **Xila Help** panel beside the browser demonstration.
2. Select **New disk**.
3. Confirm the switch when prompted.
4. Xila saves the current image, releases its Web Lock, and reloads on the new image.

A fresh disk boots with the **administrator** account and an empty password. The bundled Calculator, Clock, and Pixel Painter applications are installed during startup.

## Switch to another saved disk

1. In **Available disks**, select the target image.
2. Choose **Use selected disk**.
3. Confirm the restart.

The current disk stops accepting new writes while Xila commits pending changes. After the lock is released, the page reloads using the selected image. The selection is remembered for this browser origin.

Only one Xila tab can hold a given disk's Web Lock at a time. Different tabs may use different disks.

## Remove an unused disk

1. Select a disk that is not active in the current tab.
2. Choose **Remove**.
3. Confirm the permanent deletion.

The browser refuses removal when another Xila tab currently owns that disk. Close the tab using it, then retry. The active disk is not offered for removal from its own tab.

## Clear the whole origin

Use the browser's site-data settings only when you deliberately want to remove all storage for the demonstration's origin. This is broader than removing one disk from the Help panel.

## Verify completion

After switching or creating a disk, confirm that the expected files and account are visible. A newly created image should contain the default administrator and bundled applications; an existing image should preserve its own users, files, and configuration.

An invalid existing image or a mount error does not trigger an automatic reset. Xila preserves the image and stops with an error instead of formatting it.
