# Validate a Xila change

After the repository split, there is no single all-repositories Core test command. **Validate within the owning repository**, then use Platforms integration checks when multiple repositories interact.

## Portable Core change

From the `core` checkout:

```sh
export XILA_APPLICATIONS_ROOT="$(realpath ../applications)"
export XILA_APPLICATIONS_MANIFEST="$XILA_APPLICATIONS_ROOT/Cargo.toml"
export XILA_FONT_CATALOG_ROOTS="$XILA_APPLICATIONS_ROOT"
mise run format:rust -- --check
mise run format:toml -- --check
mise run check:all
mise run clippy:all
mise run test:workspace
mise run docs:host
```

The portable graphics/font/linker, VFS, synchronization, networking and cryptographic paths have additional focused tests in Core's <CodeReference path=".github/workflows/ci.yml" /> and <CodeReference path=".github/workflows/extended.yml" />. Core Pages now builds **only Core's Rustdoc**.

Core's integration tests that build official guests need a compatible external Applications checkout, not a missing `core/executables` directory:

```sh
export XILA_APPLICATIONS_MANIFEST="$(realpath ../applications/Cargo.toml)"
export XILA_APPLICATIONS_ROOT="$(realpath ../applications)"
export XILA_FONT_CATALOG_ROOTS="$(realpath ../applications)"
```

Use matching Git-pinned revisions or an explicit patch file when testing local changes.

## Applications or Wasmi change

From the `applications` checkout:

```sh
mise run check:guest
mise run build:applications
mise run test:workspace
mise run localization:lint
```

For Wasmi and guest bindings, run the ABI translation and guest-memory-width tests configured by <CodeReference repo="applications" path=".github/workflows/ci.yml" />. That CI also validates the unsigned development package workflows. Check host/guest features independently.

## Platforms / demo / hardware change

From the `platforms` checkout:

```sh
mise run build:native
mise run check:browser
mise run test:seed
mise run test:drivers
```

For an assembled browser image, build matching `.wasm` guests in Applications and set `XILA_APPLICATIONS_DIR` before `mise run image:browser`. For the **full localized deployment path**, invoke:

```sh
MISE_ENV=ci mise run pages:build
```

The browser test surface includes OPFS persistence, UI events, application lifecycle and disk initialization. The <CodeReference repo="platforms" path=".github/workflows/integration.yml" /> workflow accepts explicit Core and Applications commits for compatibility testing.

### Browser behavior

Run a freshly seeded installation and check Calculator, launcher, mouse/keyboard input, close/reopen and disk save/reload. Test on the new origin [platforms.xila.dev](https://platforms.xila.dev/) rather than assuming browser disks migrate from the old Core Pages origin. Existing stored disks are not updated by publishing a new seed.

## Completion and limits

Record the exact commit revisions of **all three** repositories, the locale, selected features/targets, commands executed and any hardware limitations. Native/Chrome CI does **not** establish correctness on ESP32, nor measured flash/peak RAM/stack usage.
