# Set up a development environment

Xila is now developed in **three Rust workspaces**. [Core](https://github.com/xila-project/core) owns portable OS libraries; [Applications](https://github.com/xila-project/applications) owns official apps and Wasmi; [Platforms](https://github.com/xila-project/platforms) owns native/browser assembly, hardware drivers, demos and reference images.

All three use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) and Rust with repo-specific tasks. **Do not run the old `image:native`, `image:wasm` or `pages:demo` instructions in Core.**

## Prepare checkouts

On a supported x86_64 Debian/Ubuntu Linux development machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xila-project/core.git
git clone https://github.com/xila-project/applications.git
git clone https://github.com/xila-project/platforms.git

cd core
mise trust
mise bootstrap packages apply --manager apt
mise run deps:npm
mise run check:all
cd ../applications
mise trust
npm ci
mise run build:applications
cd ../platforms
mise trust
mise bootstrap packages apply --manager apt
npm ci
mise run build:native
```

The three manifests pin dependent Git revisions. Checking out the latest `main` in each directory **does not automatically override those pins**. For cross-repository development, generate the explicit Cargo patch file from <CodeReference repo="platforms" path="tools/dev/local_overrides.py" /> rather than editing locked dependencies casually. Do not commit a `Cargo.lock` regenerated under temporary local patches.

The exact native OS, linker, graphics/font and display dependencies vary by operation. Mise selects task-scoped tool versions and optional mr-boxington caching; `MISE_ENV=ci` uses separate CI definitions.

## Select the repository for the task

| What you want to do | Where to run it |
| --- | --- |
| Portable VFS, Task, Time, Graphics, Network, ABI and device APIs | `core` |
| WASI applications, Wasmi, graphical/CLI shells, localization of applications | `applications` |
| Native/browser runtime, Linux/ESP drivers, seed images, OPFS and deployment | `platforms` |
| Manifest/TAR development packages | `package_manager` |
| Static community publication declarations | `packages` |

To assemble a desktop or browser demonstration, build WASI apps first, then point Platforms at them:

```sh
cd platforms
export XILA_APPLICATIONS_DIR="$(realpath ../applications/target/wasm32-wasip1/release-wasm)"
export XILA_FONT_CATALOG_ROOTS="$(realpath ../applications)"
mise run image:native
```

For the browser use `image:browser`. The CI-only `pages:build` task can build complete localized demonstrations itself.

## Hardware and validation limits

A native Core/Platforms build does **not** establish ESP32 or Wokwi firmware support. The split still contains legacy ESP driver code needing target-specific validation. Build and flash with the intended ESP-IDF/toolchain, partition and board configuration before claiming hardware support.
